My wife and family, includig the in-laws, have been supportive of my PhD pursuit since the beginning.
Their kindness and understanding has really helped me maintain the course.
On our daily runs, my wife and I share our thoughts of the day.
These runs really help me organize my thoughts and added some structure to my work.

My advisor, Adrian Roitberg, has been extraordinarly helpful.
I struggled often throughout this work and would run in road block along the way.
Even a short meeting with him, would often get me started again.

The Tretiak group at Los Alamos was kind enough to host me for a couple of months to gain aquaintance with their NEXMD software package.
During this stay I was able to immediately ask questions to the maintainers about software.
I hope my incessitant questions were not too much an annoyance.

Finally I want to thank all the member in the Roitberg group who not only helped me with this work, but also made it much less lonely.
I want to give special thanks to Dr. Pancham La Gupta and Dr. Justin Smith who notoriously helped me with my qualifier while being snowed-in at a bunker outside of Yosemite.
Kavindri Ranasinghe and Christian Deveroux for their company in room 402. 
I want to thank Delaram Ghoreishi and Farhad Ramezanghorbani for allowing me to quiz them about the dissertation process.
Everyone from the group has been exceptional and I'll forever value the friendships I made there.
