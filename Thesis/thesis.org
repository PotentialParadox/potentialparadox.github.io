  My wife and family, includig the in-laws, have been supportive of my PhD pursuit since the beginning.
  Their kindness and understanding has really helped me maintain the course.
  On our daily runs, my wife and I share our thoughts of the day.
  These runs really help me organize my thoughts and added some structure to my work.

  My advisor, Adrian Roitberg, has been extraordinarly helpful.
  I struggled often throughout this work and would run in road block along the way.
  Even a short meeting with him, would often get me started again.

  The Tretiak group at Los Alamos was kind enough to host me for a couple of months to gain aquaintance with their NEXMD software package.
  During this stay I was able to immediately ask questions to the maintainers about software.
  I hope my incessitant questions were not too much an annoyance.

  Finally I want to thank all the member in the Roitberg group who not only helped me with this work, but also made it much less lonely.
  I want to give special thanks to Dr. Pancham La Gupta and Dr. Justin Smith who notoriously helped me with my qualifier while being snowed-in at a bunker outside of Yosemite.
  Kavindri Ranasinghe and Christian Deveroux for their company in room 402. 
  I want to thank Delaram Ghoreishi and Farhad Ramezanghorbani for allowing me to quiz them about the dissertation process.
  Everyone from the group has been exceptional and I'll forever value the friendships I made there.

  We present a method to link the Non-adiabatic-Excited-state Molecular Dynamics (NEXMD) package to the SANDER package supplied by AMBERTOOLS, to provide excited-state adiabatic and nonadiabtic QM/MM simulations.
  NEXMD is a computational package particularly developped to perform simulations of the photoexcitation and subsequent nonadiabatic electronic and vibrational energy relaxation and redistribution in large multichormophoric conjugated molecules, a process that involves several coupled electronic excited states.
  In this work, we use it solely for its capability to perform excited-state adiabatic dynamics.
  In this report, we first describe the basic methodology behind the code, where we briefly describe the general principals behind excited state adiabatic dynamics simulations performed in NEXMD and the QM/MM calculations performed by SANDER.
  We outline the flowchart connecting them in order to optimize their exchange allowing excited state adiabatic dynamics simulations of large conjugated materials in explicit solvent.
  To validate functionality, we analyze the dynamics of a polyphenylene vinylene oligomer (PPV3-NO2) in vacuum and various explicit solvents.
  We highlight the system's ability to generate optical spectrum, view state-dependent conformational changes, and view quantum bond orderings.

Humans most likely noticed power of the sun to turn their skin red and itchy far before they even developed language.
Records show the interest of reducing the bleaching dyes.
The documents describing the mirror of Archimedes demonstrates that humans desire to harness this power dates back at leas multiple millinea.
Our understanding began to formalized in the late 1700s when Priestly experiments shined light on the processes of oxidations and sparked a curiosity that led to further experimentations with photosynthesis and photochemistry in general.
Since then, researchers have further advanced our knowledge of these effects and our ability to harness the power of light.

     - S1 and S2 represent the first two singlet electronic excited states from S0.
     - T1 represents the lowest triplet excited state.
     - During photo-excitation via absorption the molecule is instantenously excited to the electronic state S2.
     - After excitation the molecule quickly relaxes along the the new potetial energy surface lowering it vibrational/rotational state in the non-radiative process called internal-conversionwhere the energy is transfered to the external enviornment via coulombic effects, or spread to other vibrational/rotational modes throughout the molecule..
     - The molecule is allowed to transition to lower poes at any point, but occur most commonly near crossings between the potential energy surfaces.
     - The molecule may also transition from the singlet excited states to the triplet via a process called intersystem crossings.
     - The system will continue to relax via internal conversion or or intersystem crosssings until it reaches either the lowest S1 or T1 states.
     - The final step will be the radiative processes of fluorescence from the singlet state, or phosphorescence from the triplet state to the ground state.

     - Rotational conversion 1 kJ/mol
     - Vibrational conversion 10 kj/mol
     - Continues until the last excited state.
     - Radiation generally occurs from the last excited state due to Kasha's rule. \cite{kasha1950characterization}
     - Ground state is almost alway near it minimum
     - The transition is assumed to be much quicker than the period of the vibrational modes.
     - Transitions are decided based on the how close the energy difference is to the laser excitation as well at the oscillator strength which is proportional to the transition dipole moment.
     - While using classical dynamics for the nuclear coordinates, this transition dipole is determined using the electronic wavefunctions only.
     - Because of the dependence on the tranistion dipole moment, transitions between similar symmmetries are unlikely.

Figure \ref{fig:jablonski} A shows whats referred to as a Jablonski diagrams.
S\(_0-2\) represent the potential energy surfaces for the three lowest singlet states.
T\(_1\) represents the first excited triplet state.
No vibrational or rotational modes are shown since we will treat these classically.
Immediately after an electron photon absorption, the molecule is promoted to an excited state, as can be seen by the purple arrow.
This excited state could either the one immediately above it, or it could be one the many above that one.
The decision of which state to excited to is determined by the energy of the excitation and oscillator strength.

Once the molecule is at this excited states, ignoring high temperature, it will relax back towards the ground state.
There are two primary mechanisms through which this can occur.
The first is by releasing the energy thermally either throughout the rest of the molecule or to the environment. This method is referred to as internal conversion and manifests as reductions to the vibrational and rotational modes.
The second is through photon-emission.
A photo-emission process from the first excited state to the ground state is referred to as fluorescence, and can be seen by the green arrow in the figure.
Fluorescence occur over period of nanoseconds.
Tranistion processeses from singlet states to the triplet states are possible dependent on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling, in a process called intersystem conversion.
Photo-emmission from the triplet state to the ground state would be called phosphorescence.
Phosphorescence is relatively very rare compared to fluorescence with time order ~1s.
For this reason we do not consider this behavior in our simulations.

Kashas rule states that photon-emission occurs only in appreciable yields from the lowest excited state to the ground state.\cite{Kasha1950}
This rule suggests that in most cases where an electron is excited to a state beyond the first excited state, that electron will have to relax to the first excited state by means of internal conversion.\cite{shenai2016internal}
Also, for any luminescence to occur, there needs to be strong coupling between the ground and first excited state.

Figure \ref{fig:jablonski} B, is a zoomed in picture of the portion of Figure 1b surrounded by the orange circle.
When the molecule is excited to S2 through photo-excitation, it will begin to relax along S2's potential energy surface following the orange arrow.
In reality, this process would be quantized and occur as a gradual reduction in the vibration and rotational modes.
In our simulations though, we treat these reduction classically and the molecule can move smoothly along the potential energy surface of each excited state. 
However, eventually the molecule traversing the potential energy surface of S2 will cross the potential energy surface of S1.
At these crossings, there is generally strong couplings between the two states.
This coupling allows the molecule to transition from S2 to S1.
A choice now needs to made whether to stay on potential energy surface of the S2 or switch to S1.

     - Assumption that the electrons move much quicker than the nuclear coordinates is called the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
     - This appoximation is commonly made for computational chemistry calculations.
     - If following this appoximation, it is not possible to transition from one excited state to another.
     - Each of the lines show a singuluar adiabatic potential energy surface.
     - While using clasisical dynamics, the molecule is free to move continuously along any one of these surfaces.
     - To simulate a hop we must go beyond the born-oppenheimer approximation.
     :END:
#+begin_src latex
In computation chemistry it is common to assume that electrons move significantly faster than nuclei and treat the nuclei as parameters to the equations used to solve for electronic behaviors.
This assumption is known as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and forces the molecule to traverse along a single potential enery surface making it impossible for trasitions from one excited state to another to occur.
Simulations of traversals restricted to a single potential energy surface is referred to as adiabatic dynamics.
Simulations that allow such crossings are non-adiabatic.

During ultra-fast photovolatic processes, the Born-Openheimer appoximation breaks, and accounting for non-adiabatic behavior become necessary.
These situations occur frequently within processes of interest to photochemistry and photophysics.
For example, the excitation to a non-equlibrium state followed by a relaxation through internal conversion is a process common to processes such as photosynthesis, solar-cell photo-absoprtion, optical detectors, and the excitation of the visual nerve.
Photon absorption is also a requirement in certain reactions that need that last little kick.\cite{vincent2016little}
The S\(_1\) and S\(_2\) lines figure \ref{fig:jablonski} represent crossing between potential energy surfaces.

The two most common methods to extend the Born Oppenheimer appoximations are through a mean field, ofter referred to as Ehrenfest, or through molecular dynamics with quantum tranistions (MDQT).\cite{Hammes-Schiffer1994}
Alternative methods using mixed quantum-classical dynamics do exist and are used in the field. \cite{habershon2013ring,kapral2006progress}
In Ehrenfest methods, the forces acting on the molecule at any timestep is the population weighted average of the forces acting at all relevant excited states.
In MDQT methods only the forces of one state is used for any single time-step. \cite{prezhdo1997evaluation}
Between timesteps, the molecule is allowed to transition between states.
To simulate state populations, MDQT methods employ a swarm of independent trajectories.
Each trajectory is given a different random seed and allowed to hop between states based on the non-adiabatic couplings.
Study of the system's behavior is then done based on the statistics of the ensemble.

Figures \ref{fig:surfaceHoppingVsMeanField} A and B attempt to show the practical differences between these two methods.
The population chart on the left shows the probability of being in states S1 and S2 at some arbitrary time.
These probabilities merge to around 0.5 each at around the halfway point.

The right figure presents arbitrary state energies over the same time frame for this trajectory.
The dashed lines represent the energies along the Ehrenfest trajectory.
Blue and red represent the S2 and S1 energies repectively.
The black dashed line represents the Ehrenfest mean-field energy determined as the population weighted average energies of S1 and S1.
As the probability of state S2 drops from one, the mean-field energy diverges from that of S2.
Eventually the mean field energy becomes the average of a S1 and S2.

The solid lines represent the the energies along two separate surface hopping trajectories.
At around the halfway point, the trajectory SH-S1 hops from the S2 to S1.
Trajectory SH-S2 remains on S2.
Because these trajectories are allowed to be moved by forces generated at their respective potential energy surfaces, their energies will in general be lower than their mean field counterparts.
Notice that the average energy of the hop trajectories will also diverge from the Ehrenfest method.

       - figure shows a slow crossing and quick crossing.
       - during a slow crossing, the nuclear coordinates are moving slowly compared to the electronic coordinates
       - The probability to hop from one pes to the other is going to be determined by the coupling of these two states, known as the non-adiabatic coupling.
       - This coupling is proportional to the overlap between the nuclear velocities and the non-adiabatic coupling vectors which are inversely proportional to the energy differences.
       - In general, the steeper the delta energy curve, and the closer the energies, the more probable the hop.
       - It is possible for the energies of separate states to cross without a transition occuring, proper accounting accounting must be taken account.

#+begin_src latex
In this work, we model the interstate transitions using the MDQT algorithm, Tully's Fewest Switches.
The probability of hopping from one state to another is proportional to the coupling between the states known as the nonadiabatic coupling.
These nonadiabatic coupling are dependent in part on the energy differences between the states, and the nuclear velocities.
Figure \ref{fig:naCrossings} shows three approaches from potential surfaces S1 and S2.
Assume that the molecule is originally on state S2.
When the the energy differences are relatively large, with a shallow approach as in the left figure, the coupling is weak, and hops become unlikely.
When the aproach is steep, and the energy difference small, the nuclear velocities no longer become negligible, the Born Oppenheimer approximation breaks, strong coupling exists, and a respective hop become likely.
In the far right figure, the energies of the two states cross.
In general states in molecular dynamics programs are refered to based on their energy orderings.
In this situation, the orderings of these potential energy sufaces swicth and S1\(\rightarrow\)S2 and vice versa.
If no adiabatic hopping occurs, the molecule remains on the same potential energy suface.
However, the energy levels will have have switched and we need to ensure that molecule traverses along the new S1 state.
This can be done by comparing overlaps between the states between timesteps.

        \subsection{Solvent Effects}
    The determination of which state to excited to is strongly affected by the transition dipole moments.
    These transition dipole moments are sensitive to polarization from external electronic fields or charges.
    The energy differences between the excited states can also be affected by these external charges due to (de)-stabalization of the dipoles.
This ability of the solvent to affect the spctra of a solute is known a solvatochromism. \cite{marini2010solvatochromism}
    Systems with strong electric fields occur frequently in biological systems.\cite{park1999vibrational,kriegl2003ligand}
    These electric field can have profound effect on the steady state fluorescnce and absorption spectra through the Stark effect. \cite{Park2013}
    The solvents in these systems can extend or shield these effects.
    In fact, solvents themselves can induce the effect.
    The Stark effect is largely responsible for red shift in emissions of protiends that occurs in fluid solvents with high dielectric constants.\cite{callis1997tryptophan,park1999vibrational}
    Solvents provide a large source of external charges that can significantly affect the non-adiabatic behavior and characteristics of a molecule.\cite{furukawa2015external}
    The effects of the envioronment on the spectra can be used to develop environmental sensitive fluorescence probes. \cite{klymchenko2004bimodal}
    For example 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaph-thalene experiences a very noticable emission color shift with the addition of cholesterol.\cite{massey1998effect,bondar1999preferential}

    For many areas in which nonadiabatic dynamics simulations would be of interest, solvents play a crucial role.
\cite{bagchi1989dynamics,woo2005solvent}
    In situations where ultrafast electronic relaxations occur, the electronic decay is often faster than the time for the solvent to equilibrate.
    As such, Implicit solvents, which adjusts instantaneously to any changes, become imprecise approximation.
    However performing non-adiabatic dynamics on such large systems is far too computationally expensive.
    To ease the computational cost we can employ QM/MM methodologies to perform the non-adiabatic calculation only on the areas of interest.
    Similar methods have been employed in the study of retinal photochemistry and organic semiconductors.\cite{weingart2012modelling,demoulin2017fine,heck2015multi,bayliss1954solvent}%\cite{demoulin2017fine, weingart2012modelling, heck2015multi}
    In this work we implement a new method of performing non-adiabatic QM/MM using the SANDER package AMBERTOOLS combined with the high performance Non-Adiabatic simulator NEXMD.
    We further analyze the effects of including near solvent molecules within the QM region.

	In the previous sections we have discussed how quantum mechanics can be used for chemical calculations.
  However, in many applications, the accuracy of QM is not needed and more computationally cheaper method would be more appropriate.
	For these situations many computational chemist use classical electrical force field dynamics, treating atoms as point charges.
	QM/MM was developed to manage computational costs by separating a calculation into a quantum mechanical (QM) region and a classical mechanical (MM) region.\cite{warshel1976theoretical,Karplus2014}
	This allows the user to have the accuracy where needed while not wasting resources on unwanted calculations such as the dynamics of water molecules far from the protein of interest.
	For the vast majority of our calculations, we will have a QM solute and a few nearby QM solvents surrounded by MM solvents.

	Figure \ref{fig:QMMMDiagram} gives an example of a QM/MM systems.
	The atoms of the drawn out molecule will be described at the QM level of theory.
	The MM atoms in the volume immediately surrounding the molecular, label QMCut, will be the MM atoms included in equation \ref{eq:qmmm}.
	To simulate a solute in solvent, we treat the provided box as a cell, that is repeated infinitely many times.
	Particle Mesh Ewald calculations are then used to calculate the long distance interactions of the periodic boxes.
	This is performed by treating the charge and potential in the long range, inter box distances, as sums in Fourier space.\cite{Darden1993}
	Note that the QM region must be treated as single point charges for this calculations.
	The Mulliken charges of the current state are used for these calculations.
	Once the sums are complete, a fast Fourier transform is performed to obtain energy and forces.
	Charges from the MM region outside QMCut, will be used to provide a Particle Mesh Ewald correction to the new Fock Matrix.\cite{Walker2008}

	Long range interaction, from those outside the cutoff, considered vital for the understanding of solvent effects, are treated using SQM’s implementation of Particle Mesh Ewald.
	Trajectories use periodic boundary conditions to simulate an explicit solution, treating the system box as cells repeated infinitely many times in all directions.
	Particle Mesh Ewald calculations then determine the long-distance interactions of these periodic boxes, treating the charges and potentials in the long-range inter-box distances as sums in Fourier space treating atoms in the QM region of these calculations as Mulliken point charges.
	Once the sums are complete, SQM performs a fast Fourier transformation to obtain the long-range corrections to the energy and forces.

** TWO Organic Conjugate Molecules
#+begin_src latex
\section{Organic Conjugated Molecules}
Conjugated organic polymers are a class of organic semiconductors.
They have been know to show electroluminescence since popes discovery in the 1960s. cite(brown1992poly:1).
They have facinated scientis ever since the discory of their high conductiity after a redox chemical treatment in 1976.\cite{chiang1977electrical}
Unlike inorganic semiconductors, the excited electrons from an organic semiconductor are bound to the hole forming an exciton.\cite{scholes2011excitons}
These exciton from organic semicondors are capable of moving from one segment to another while keeping quantum coherence. \cite{collini2009coherent}
They descirbe a class of molecules in which the backbone is fully composed of a continuous line of \(\pi\) orbital containing atoms, most commonly carbon atoms. 
They exibit this semiconductor behavior due to the delocalized \(\pi\) molecular orbitals that traverse a segment of the chain when that segment is planar.\cite{bredas1999excited}
Conjugate organic polymers have been shown to exhibit ultra-fast exciton decay.\cite{nelson2018coherent,Fernandez-Alberti2009}
The interest in the conjugated materieals is often not as a replacement for inorganic semiconductors such as silicon but rather for their other characteristics such as their low cost, sythesis versalitiy and flexibility. \cite{Bredas1999excited}

Studies have been performed to determine whether we can sythesize unidirectional energy transfers in these systems.\cite{soler2012analysis,soler2014signature,Galindo2015,FernandezAlberti2010,FernandezAlberti2012}
The have a dense manifold of electronic states.
They have strong electron-phonon couplings.\cite{tretiak2002conformational,nelson2011nonadiabatic,nelson2014nonadiabatic}
They have photophysical properties that are rare. \cite{bredas1999excited,spano2000emission}
Small changes to the chemical structure can significantly effect the photophysical properties.\cite{andre1991quantum}
Due also in part to their low cost of production a heavy interest has been show in using them for technological development.\cite{granstrom1998laminated,cao1999improved,sirringhaus2000high,bredas2004charge,bredas2009excitons,bredas2009molecular,collini2009coherent}
Experimentally, these molecules are studied either in solution or in a solid state samples.
These types of scenarios have been too computationall expensive to siulate explicitely, and have only recently been studied using implice solvents.\cite{sifain2018photoexcited,sifainbjorgaard2018}

A decade after the discovery of the high condictivity of organic conjugated molecules, the first polymer LED was developed using Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV).\cite{brown1992poly}
PPV like other conjugated organic polymers possess ultra-fast exciton relaxations.
Its bond length alternation dependence on the lowest excited state destabalized the would be lowest singlet 2A\(_g\) state that would be forbidden and cause the 1B\(_u\) state to be the lowest allowing the molecule to luminesce.\cite{soos1993band}
PPV therefore has a sufficiently weak electron-hole binding energy to produce a much higher luminescence efficiency than the 25\% that would be expected with strong electron-hold binding. \cite{cao1999improved}
Its nonlinear response to electronic excitations has has made it an excellent candidate to development of solid state light emmitting diodes (LEDs). \cite{burroughes1990light} (cite:cornil:11-15)
It as been of great interest since the discovery a two-step fabrication process that made its production cheap and efficient decades ago. (cite:cornil:1-5)
Possessing 2 chromophores connected by a conjugated bridge, PPV can be called a charge-transfer probe.
The local and bulk photophysicial properties of charge-transfer probes are known to be very sensitive to enviromental effects.\cite{marini2010solvatochromism}
Understanding how these effects modify electron-hole separation and mobility could significantly help the devolopment of futher light harvesting advancements.
Can also be used as transitors, or sensors. (cite:granstrom:oneof(6-10))
The photo-physical properties have been heavily researched both experimentally and theoretical.
The optimized geometrie of the excited states differ significantly from the ground state.
The excited state is more planar and there is significant alternation in the bond lengths of the vinyle groups.
These configuration differences provide a fast analysis measure through BLA and a slow one by analyzing the changes in the torsional angles around the vinyle groups.
The local photochemical properties of charge transfer probes with hydrogen bonding sites such as a nitro group are known to be sensitive to the hydrogen-bonding properities of solvents.  \cite{marini2010solvatochromism}
Previous research has also shown that exciton motion coherency along PPV is heavily dependent on the solvent. \cite{collini2009coherent}
And its been suggested that efficiencies in the exciton migration within PPV derivatives could be improved selecting solvents that would promote exented conformations.\cite{bredas2009excitons}
For these reasons we choose for our anlysis the PPV ogilimer PPV\(_3\)-NO\(_2\) shown in figure \ref{fig:PPV3-NO2}

*** THREE Solving the schrodinger equation
    - [ ] Add section about using guassians instead of slater-type orbitals
    #+begin_src latex
    \section{Electronic Structure}\label{secular}

    The goal of computational chemistry is to solve the Schrodinger equation.
    Solving it completely is only possible for very small subsets of possible situations.
    In most cases, significant approximations must be made.
    One of the more common such approximations, is to approximate the total single electron molecular orbitals contribution to the many electron wavefunction as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).
    \begin{equation}
      \Phi=\sum_{i}c_i\phi_i
    \end{equation}
    where \(\Phi\) is the molecular spatial orbital, \(c_i\) the coefficient, and \(\phi_i\) the atomic orbitals.
    Atomic orbitals are often designed to resemble hydrogen like orbitals and are themselves often composed of a linear combination of guassians to simplify integrations.
    Inclusion of the spin creates the spin orbital
    \begin{equation}
      \chi = \Phi \sigma
    \end{equation}
    where the spin \(\sigma\) can be either \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\)

    For each single electron molecular orbital, the Schodinger equation can be written as
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:oneeenergy}
      E(\chi) = \frac{\left<\right.\chi\left|\right.\bm{H}\left.\right|\chi\left>\right.}{\left<\right.\chi\left.\right|\left.\chi\left.\right.\right>}
    \end{equation}
    where $\mathbf{H}$ the Hamiltonian and $E$ the energy of the single electron orbital.
    We can expand the numerator and denominator of the right-hand side of equation \ref{eq:oneeenergy}

    \begin{align}
      \label{eq:variation1}
      \left<\right.\chi\left|\right.\bm{H}\left.\right|\chi\left>\right.&=
      \left( \sum_{i} c_i \phi_i \right) \mathbf{H} \left( \sum_j c_j \phi_j \right) &
      \left<\right.\chi\left.\right|\left.\chi\left.\right.\right>&=
      \left( \sum_{i} c_i \phi_i \right) \left( \sum_j c_j \phi_j \right)  \\
      &= \sum_{ij} c_{i}c_j H_{ij} & &= \sum_{ij} c_{i}c_j S_{ij} 
      \label{eq:variation2}
    \end{align}

    Taking the partial derivatives of both sides with respect to coefficient of molecular orbital a in
    equation \ref{eq:variation2} provides us with

    \begin{align}
      \label{eq:variationexpansion}
      \frac{\partial}{\partial c_{\alpha}}
      \left<\right.\chi\left|\right.\bm{H}\left.\right|\chi\left>\right.&=
      2c_\alpha H_{\alpha \alpha} + \sum_{\alpha j \neq \alpha} 2c_j H_{\alpha j} &
      \frac{\partial}{\partial c_{\alpha}}
      \left<\right.\chi\left.\right|\left.\chi\left.\right.\right>&=
      2 c_\alpha S_{\alpha\alpha} + \sum_{\alpha j \neq \alpha} c_j S_{\alpha j}
    \end{align}

    If we multiply both sides of equation \ref{eq:oneeenergy} by
    $\left<\right.\chi\left.\right|\left.\chi\left.\right.\right>$ and
    take the partial derivative with respect to $c_{\alpha}$,

    \begin{align}
      \frac{\partial}{\partial c_{\alpha}}
      \left( E \left<\right.\chi\left.\right|\left.\chi\left.\right.\right> \right)&=
      \frac{\partial}{\partial c_{\alpha}}
      \left<\right.\chi\left|\right.\bm{H}\left.\right|\chi\left>\right. \\
      \label{eq:variation3}
      E \frac{\partial \left<\right.\chi\left.\right|\left.\chi\left.\right.\right>}{\partial c_{\alpha}}
      + \left<\right.\chi\left.\right|\left.\chi\left.\right.\right> \frac{\partial E}{\partial c_{\alpha}} &=
      \frac{\partial}{\partial c_{\alpha}}
      \left<\right.\chi\left|\right.\bm{H}\left.\right|\chi\left>\right.
    \end{align}
    we can minimize $E$ by rearranging equation \ref{eq:variation3}

    \begin{equation}
      \frac{\partial E}{\partial c_{\alpha}} =
      \frac{1}{\left<\right.\chi\left.\right|\left.\chi\left.\right.\right>}
      \left[
        \frac{\left<\right.\chi\left|\right.\bm{H}\left.\right|\chi\left>\right.}
             {\partial c_{\alpha}}
             -E \frac{\left<\right.\chi\left.\right|\left.\chi\left.\right.\right>}
             {\partial c_{\alpha}}
             \right] = 0.
    \end{equation}

    Substituting our results from equation \ref{eq:variationexpansion} and
    dividing by common multipliers, we find

    \begin{equation}
      c_{\alpha} H_{\alpha \alpha} + \sum_{\alpha j \neq \alpha} c_j H_{\alpha j} -
      E \left( c_{\alpha} S_{\alpha \alpha} + \sum_{\alpha j \neq \alpha} c_j S_{\alpha j} \right) = 0
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
      c_{\alpha} H_{\alpha \alpha} + \sum_{\alpha j \neq \alpha} c_j H_{\alpha j} -
      E \left( c_{\alpha} S_{\alpha \alpha} + \sum_{\alpha j \neq \alpha} c_j S_{\alpha j} \right) = 0
    \end{equation}

    which is often referred to as the matrix form of the Schrodinger
    equation.  A more intuitive understanding of the equation may be had
    if we expand out for $\alpha=1-3$.

    \begin{equation} \label{eq:SchrodingerMatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
        H_{11}-ES_{11} & H_{12}-ES_{12} & H_{13}-ES_{13} \\
        H_{21}-ES_{21} & H_{22}-ES_{22} & H_{23}-ES_{23} \\
        H_{31}-ES_{31} & H_{32}-ES_{32} & H_{33}-ES_{33}
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
        c_1 \\
        c_2 \\
        c_3
      \end{bmatrix} = 0
    \end{equation}
    This equation can be rewritten generally as
    \begin{equation}
      \mathbf{H}\vec{c} = E \mathbf{S} \vec{c}.
    \end{equation}

*** THREE Hartree Fock                                              :ignore:
    #+begin_src latex
        \section{Hartree Fock}
        Before we can solve the secular equation we need to know our
        Hamiltonian.  We begin with the generalized Hamiltonian of a
        molecular system,\cite{engel2012quantum}

        \begin{align} \label{eq:fullhamiltonian}
          \begin{split}
            \mathbf{H} =& -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\sum_i^{electrons}\nabla_i^2-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\sum_{A}^{nuclei}\frac{1}{M_{A}}\nabla_{A}^2 - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \sum_i^{electrons}\sum_A^{nuclei}\frac{Z_A}{r_{iA}} \\
            & + \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\sum_{i}^{electrons}\sum_{j<i}^{electrons}\frac{1}{r_{ij}} + \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\sum_{A}^{nuclei}\sum_{B<A}^{nuclei}\frac{Z_AZ_B}{R_{AB}}
          \end{split}
        \end{align}
        where $n$ is summed over all the nuclei, and the $i$ and $j$ are summed over the electrons. 
        \(m_e\) and \(M_A\) are the masses of the electron and nuclei repsectively and Z the charge of the nuclei.

        With this Hamiltonian, the secular equation is near impossible to solve without some approximations.
        The one most relevant to our work is the adiabatic approximation, also known as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where because the electrons move so much quicker than the nuclei, we can set the second term of equation \ref{eq:fullhamiltonian} to zero and the last term to a constant. \cite{born1954dynamical,born1927quantentheorie}
        We can then rewrite the electron as behaving parametrically on the coordinates of the nuclei such that our total wavefunction can be split into electronic and nuclear components
        \begin{equation}
          \Psi_{total} = \sum_\alpha\psi_\alpha^{electron}(r;\mathbf{R})\psi_\alpha^{nuclei}(\mathbf{R}).
        \end{equation}
        The potential energy surface then, can be extrapolated by applying the electronic Hamiltonian $H_e$ to the wavefunction and then adding nuclear repulsion, for an array of nuclear geometries.
        In the mean field approximation, each electron feels the average potential of all the other electrons, such that the second term in the electronic hamiltonian from equation \ref{eq:helectric} our total Hamiltonian becomes $\sum_i^{electrons} V_{average}(i)$.
        The electronic parts the Hamiltonian are now decoupled, and the total Hamiltonian can now be written as a sum of individual electron Hamiltonian's plus a nuclear-nuclear repulsion constant.
        \begin{align}
          \label{eq:helectric}
          \mathbf{H}_e =& -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\sum_i^{electrons}\nabla_i^2 + \sum_i^{electrons} V_{average}(i) - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \sum_i^{electrons}\sum_A^{nuclei}\frac{Z_A}{r_{iA}} \\
          \mathbf{H}_N =& -\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\sum_{A}^{nuclei}\frac{1}{M_{A}}\nabla_{A}^2  + \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\sum_{A}^{nuclei}\sum_{B<A}^{nuclei}\frac{Z_AZ_B}{R_{AB}}
        \end{align}
We will continue this chapter in atomic units where these equations become
        \begin{align}
          \label{eq:helectric}
          \mathbf{H}_e =& -\frac{1}{2}\sum_i^{electrons}\nabla_i^2 + \sum_i^{electrons} V_{average}(i) -  \sum_i^{electrons}\sum_A^{nuclei}\frac{Z_A}{r_{iA}} \\
          \mathbf{H}_N =& -\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\sum_{A}^{nuclei}\frac{1}{M_{A}}\nabla_{A}^2  + \sum_{A}^{nuclei}\sum_{B<A}^{nuclei}\frac{Z_AZ_B}{R_{AB}}
        \end{align}
        In actuality the electrons of one orbit will effect electrons of the orbit of another.
        The electrons will repulse each-other and their paths will change accordingly thereby reducing the overall energy.
        This approximation to the method fails to take this into account.
        We call the difference between the actual energy $E$ and the Hartree-Fock energy $\epsilon$ the
        coulomb correlation energy $E_{corrrelation}$.
        %There have been numerous ways developed to help alleviate this problem, including perturbation theory, coupled cluster theory, and higher lever configuration interaction.

        In most simulations more than a single electron needs to be considered.
        In these systems, the total electron wavefunction must statisfy the Pauli-Exclusion principle.
        That is, all electrons should be treated as indistinguishable, no more than one electron per set of quantum numbers, and the sign must inverst for any exchange of electrons.
        We can fulfill that requirement, if we assume that a total electron wavefunction is a single slater-determinant of single electron molecular orbitals.

        \begin{equation} \label{eq:slater-determinant} \psi(\bm{r};\bm{R}) =
          \left|p \cdots s\right> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
          \begin{vmatrix}
            \chi_{p}(\bm{r}_1) & \cdots & \cdots \chi_{s}(\bm{r}_1) \\
            \vdots             & \ddots         &       \vdots      \\
            \chi_{p}(\bm{r}_n) & \cdots & \cdots \chi_{s}(\bm{r}_n)
          \end{vmatrix}
        \end{equation}
        where \(\psi\) is the total many electron wavefuntion that depend parametrically on the nuclear coordinates due to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
        The $p \cdots s$ are the subscripts of the single electon molecular orbitals, and $1 \cdots n$ are the indices for the electrons.


        Finally, things simplify greatly if the molecular orbitals are
        othornormal to each other. $\left<\right.i\left|\right.j\left>\right. = \delta_{ij}$.
        Intuition tells us that because the Hamiltonian is an operator that
        acts on at most 2 electrons at a time, and the electron orbitals
        are orthonormal, any perturbation beyond 2 will integrate to 0.  In
        fact, there's a whole set of rules to reduce electron integral
        summations called the Slater-Condon rules.

        \begin{enumerate}
        \item
          $ \left | \cdots mn \cdots \right > \rightarrow \left | \cdots mn
          \cdots \right > \Rightarrow \sum_i \left< i \right| h \left| i
          \right> + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} \left( \left< ij | ij \right> - \left< ij | ji \right> \right) $
        \item
          $ \left | \cdots mn \cdots \right > \rightarrow \left | \cdots pn
          \cdots \right > \Rightarrow \left< m \right| h \left| p \right> +
          \sum_{i} \left( \left<mi | pi \right> - \left<mi | ip \right> \right) $
        \item
          $ \left | \cdots mn \cdots \right > \rightarrow \left | \cdots pq
          \cdots \right > \Rightarrow \left< mn | pq \right> - \left< mn | qp \right> $
        \item
          $ \left | \cdots lmn \cdots \right > \rightarrow \left | \cdots pqr
          \cdots \right > \Rightarrow 0 $
        \end{enumerate}
        where the first arrow represents the perturbations of electrons. \(\left| \cdots mn \cdots \right> \rightarrow \left| \cdots pn \cdots \right>\) would present a perturbation of a single electron.
    \(h\) is the core electron Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
h(i) = -\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^2 - \sum_{A=1}^N \frac{Z_A}{r_{iA}}
\end{equation}
The integral rule for the two electron integrals is
\begin{equation}
\left< ij | kl \right> = \int dx_1 dx_2 \chi_i^*(x_1) \chi_j^*(x_2) \frac{1}{r_{12}} \chi_k(x_1) \chi_l(x_2)
\end{equation}

        Using these rules and a bit of algebra the Hamiltonian simplifies to
        what's called the Fock operator with elements
        \begin{equation}
          F_{\mu\nu} = h_{\mu\nu}
          + \sum_{\lambda \sigma} P_{\lambda \sigma}
          \left(
          \left< \mu \lambda \right| \nu \sigma \left>\right.
          - \frac{1}{2} \left< \mu \nu \right| \lambda \sigma \left>\right.
          \right)
        \end{equation}

        which can be substituted for $H$ in equation \ref{eq:SchrodingerMatrix} to produce the Roothan-Hall equation
        \begin{equation}
          \mathbf{Fc}=\varepsilon\mathbf{Sc},
        \end{equation}
        where $\varepsilon$ has replace $E$ to be the orbital hartree-fock energies.
        We simplify this further by using the semi-empirical AM1, which uses predetermined factors for the four term integrations as will be discussed later in the semi-emprical section.
        We can now apply the variational method to determine the coefficient of the wavefunction.
        First, a trial density function is chosen, which is equivalent to a trial coefficient vector.
        We then solve the Roothan-Hall equation, save the lowest eigenvalue energy and use the corresponding coefficient vector to create a density function for another iteration.
        We compare the energy differences between iterations until it's less than a chosen value. 
        Indices i and j are summed over all electrons.

    \section{Configuration Interaction}
	The previous calculations resulted in a slater determinant filled with molecular orbitals that approximates the ground state.
	In order to determine the excited states, further steps must be performed.
	Steps performed after Hartree Fock, are appropriately named post Hartree Fock Methods.
	In this work we use the configuration interaction methodology.

	The Hartree fock's slater determinant, \(\Phi_0\), contains the lowest energy molecular orbitals.
	These filled orbitals are known as the occupied orbitals which will label with letters ab....
	The other available orbitals that weren't filled are considered virtual, labeled ij....

	New determinants can be made by swapping virtual and occupied orbitals.

	For example
	\begin{equation}
	  \bm{\Phi}_c^i
	\end{equation}
	would be a determinant created by swapping the occupied orbital \(c\) with the virtual orbital \(i\) and
	\begin{equation}
	  \bm{\Phi}_{cd}^{ij}
	\end{equation}
	would be a determinant created by swapping occupied orbitals \(c\) and \(d\) with orbitals \(i\) and \(j\).

	For K occupied orbitals, only K swaps can be made for a single determinant.
	For each molecular orbital, there are two spin states \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) which means for K orbitals, and N electrons, there are
	\begin{equation}
	  2K \choose N
	\end{equation}
	The full CI wavefunction, \(\bm{Psi}\), is linear combination of all of these determinants.
This method provides the exact solution to the Shrodinger equation within the basis set.
	The choose function limits the use full CI to small molecules.

	For larger molecules, the swap is limited to single, referred to as configuration interaction singles (CIS), to doubles (CID), or to both (CISD).
	For CIS, the new wavefunction can be written as

	\begin{equation}
	\bm{\Psi}_{CIS} = c_0\bm{\Phi}_0 + c_a^i\sum_i^N\sum_a^{K-N}\bm{\Phi}_a^i
	\end{equation}
	where \(c_0\) and \(\Phi_0\) are the coefficients and determinant for the Hartree Fock ground state.

	To solve for these coefficients, we use a similar method of solving an eigenvalue equation like that performed in \ref{secular}.

	\begin{equation}
	  \bm{H}\vec{c} = \bm{e} \bm{S} \vec{c}
	\end{equation}
	where
	\begin{align}
	  H_{ji} &= \left<\bm{\Phi}_b^j \right| \bm{H} \left| \bm{\Phi}_a^i \right>
	  S_{ji} &= \left<\bm{\Phi}_b^j | \bm{\Phi}_a^i \right>
	\end{align}
	are the Hamiltonian \(\bm{H}\) and overlap \(\bm{S}\) matrices.
	When diaganolized, \(\vec{c}\) and \(\bm{e}\) are the coefficients and the energies of the CIS wave functions composed as a linear sum of the exchange determinants.

	When using CIS, the addition of the single exchange determinants have no effect on the ground state.
	Some electron correlation is accounted for excited states due to the linear combination of the mixed singly excited determinants.

\section{Semiempirical Methods}
Solving the equations for the Hartree Fock method and Configuration Interaction require the integrations of many two-electon integrals.
Using the hydrogen like slater orbitals for these integrations become infeasable.
Its common to approximate these orbitals using gaussian functions.
Each atomic orbital is a linear combinataion of guassians, and each molecular orbital is using a slater determinant of these combinations.
However, computational costs still limit the solving of the Shrodinger equations in this basis to but a couple of atoms.
For larger systems, further approximations are required.
A common approximation is to replace the overlap matrix S with the unit matrix in the Roothan hall equation
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} \vec{c} = \bm{\epsilon}\mathbf{S}\vec{c}
\end{equation}
and only treat the valence electrons quantum mechanically. \cite{christensen2016semiempirical}
The approach is called the zero-differential overlap approximation.
This approximation reduces the cost order of the integrations from \(O(N_{\text{electrons}})^4\) to \(O(N_{\text{valence electrons}})^2\).
The cost can be further reduced by approximating the remaining (ii|jj) integrals by parameterizing the integrals to experimental data as done in the comple negelect of differential overlap methods.
A common correction is to reintroduce parameterized integral approximations for (ij|kl) where ij are electrons on one atom, and kl another. \cite{pople1965approximate}
The neglect of diatomic differential overlap approximation further corrects by replacing the core-core interactions with Z\(_A\) Z\(_B\) (core\(_a\) core\(_a\) | core\(_b\) core\(_b\)).
The neglect of diatomic differential overlap is the foundation for most of whats refered to as the semiempirical methods.

    \section{Adiabatic Dynamics}
	    Excited-state calculations implement the Collective Electronic Oscillator (CEO) approach developed by Mukamel and coworkers, which solves the adiabatic equation of motion of a single electron density matrix.
	    The single-electron density matrix is defined by  

	\begin{equation}
	    \rho_{g\alpha_{nm}}t = \left< \psi_\alpha t \right| c_m^\dagger c_n \left | \psi_g t \right>
	\end{equation}

	where \(\psi_g\) and \(\psi_\alpha\) are the single-electron wave functions of the ground-state and \(\alpha\) state respectively.
	cm†(cn) is the creation(annihilation) operator summed over the atomic orbital \(m\) and \(n\), whose size is determined by the basis set.
	The basis set coefficients of these atomic orbits are calculated in the previous SCF step and account for the presence of solvents.
	The CIS approximation is applied, creating the normalization condition 

	\begin{equation}
	    \sum_{n,m} (\rho_{g\alpha})^2_{n,m} = 1
	\end{equation}

	Recognizing that \(\rho_{g\alpha}\) represents the transition density from the ground to the \(\alpha\) state, we solve the Liouville equation of motion 

	\begin{equation}
	    \hat{\mathcal{L}}\bm{\rho}_{0\alpha} = \Omega \bm{\rho}_0\alpha,
	\end{equation}
	with \(\mathcal{L}\) being the two-particle Liouville operator and \(\Omega\) the energy difference between the \(\alpha\) state and the ground state.

	The action of the Liouville operator can be found analytically by
	\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} \bm{\rho}_{o\alpha} = \left[ \bm{F}^{\vec{R}} (\bm{\rho}_{00}),\bm{\rho}_{0\alpha} \right] +
	\left[ \bm{V}^{\vec{R}} (\bm{\rho}_{0\alpha}), \bm{\rho}_{00} \right]
	\end{equation}

	where \(\bm{F}^{\vec{R}}\) is the Fock operator and \(\bm{V}^{\vec{R}}\) is teh column interchange operator.

	The diagonalization of this Liouville equation of motions uses Davidson diagonalization technique, which brings the computational costs from an otherwise O(n6) to O(n3). 

	The forces are then calculated analytically by the gradient of the ground state energy and the excited state energy. 

	\begin{equation}
	\vec{\nabla} E_\alpha = \vec{\nabla} E_0 + \vec{\nabla}\Omega_\alpha
	\end{equation}

	With the gradient of the ground state being calculated by

	\begin{equation}
	\vec{\nabla}E_0 = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr} \bm{t}^{\vec{R}} + \bm{F}^{\vec{R}}\bm{\rho}_{00}
	\end{equation}
	and the gradient of the excited state being 
	\begin{equation}
	\vec{\nabla}\Omega_\alpha = \text{Tr} \bm{F}^{\vec{R}} \left( \bm{\rho}_{\alpha\alpha} - \bm{\rho}_{00} \right) + \text{Tr} \bm{V}^{\vec{R}} \bm{\rho}_{0\alpha}^\dagger \bm{\rho}_{0\alpha}
	\end{equation}
	where \(\rho_{ij}\) represents the density or transition density matrix for states \(i\) and \(j\),
	\(\bm{F}\) is the Fock matrix,
	\(t\) is the the kinetic operator acting on one-electron, and \(\bm{V}\) is the column interchange operator.

     We define the Hamiltonian

     \begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyHamiltonian} \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{T}(\mathbf{R}) +
       \mathbf{H}_{el}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{R})
     \end{equation}
     where \(\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{R}) \) is the nuclear kinetic energy operator and \(\textbf{H}_{el}\) is the electronic Hamiltonian.

     We expand the the total wavefunction, \(\Psi\) into orthonormal adiabatic state wavefunctions \(\phi\)
     \begin{equation}
       \Psi(\textbf{r}, \textbf{R}, t) = \sum_j c_j(t)\phi_j(\textbf{r}; \textbf{R}) = c_j \left| \phi_j \right>
     \end{equation}
     where \(\textbf{r}\) and \(\textbf{R}\) are the electronic and nuclear coordinates respectively.
     \(c_j\) are complex expansion coefficients.
     Substitution into the Shrodinger equation yeilds

     \begin{align}
       i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} c_j \left | \phi _j \right> &= \mathbf{H} c_j \left | \phi_j \right>\\
       i\hbar \dot{c}_j \left | \phi \right> + i\hbar c_j \left| \dot{\phi}_j \right> &= \mathbf{H} c_j \left| \phi_j \right>\\
     \end{align}
     where we can now apply it another state \(\phi_i\) on the left.
     \begin{align} \label{eq:dcoefficient}
       i\hbar \dot{c_j} \left< \phi_i | \phi_j \right> + i\hbar c_j \left< \phi_i | \dot{\phi}_j \right> &= c_j \left< \phi_i | \mathbf{H} | \phi_j \right>\\
       \sum_j i\hbar \dot{c_j} \left< \phi_i | \phi_j \right> &= \sum_j \left(c_j \left< \phi_i | \mathbf{H} | \phi_j \right> - i\hbar c_j \left< \phi_i | \dot{\phi}_j \right> \right)\\
       i\hbar \dot{c_i} &= \sum_j \left(c_j \left< \phi_i | \mathbf{H} | \phi_j \right> - i\hbar c_j \left< \phi_i | \dot{\phi}_j \right> \right)
     \end{align}
     where we now made the sum explicit.
     The second term on the right \(\left< \phi_i | \dot{\phi}_j \right>\) is referred to as the nonadiabatic adiabatic coupling and represents the coupling between states i and j.
     This can be rewritten as 
     \begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyS3}
       \left<\phi_i\right|\dot{\phi}_j\left.\right>=\left<\phi_i\right|\frac{d\mathbf{R}}{dt}\frac{d}{d\mathbf{R}}\left|\phi_j\right>=\dot{\mathbf{R}}\cdot\mathbf{d}_{ij}(\mathbf{R})
     \end{equation}
     effectively separating the coupling term into the nuclear velocity vector \(\dot{R}\) and another vector referred to as the non-adiabatic coupling vector 
     \begin{equation} \label{eq:tullynacoupling} 
       \mathbf{d}_{kj}\mathbf(R) =
       \left<\phi_{k}(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\right|\mathbf{\nabla}_{\mathbf{R}}\left.\phi_j(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\right>.
     \end{equation}
     Equation \ref{eq:tullyS3} clearly shows that the coupling is strongest when the non-adiabatic vector is aligned with the nuclear velocities.
     Also the coupling is proportional to the magnitude of these velocities.
     Through use of the Helmann-Feynman theorem, it can alsow be shown that the magnitude of the nonadiabatic coupling vector is inversely proportional to the change in energies between the states.
     We use the Collect Oscillator Approach to calculate the non-adiabatic coupling terms \(\mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{kj}\) ``on the
     fly''. \cite{tommasini2001electronic, tretiak1996collective, tretiak2009representation, chernyak2000density,Tretiak1996,Tretiak1999}

     To simplify notation we will let
     \begin{equation}
       \mathbf{V}_{ij} = \left< \phi_i | \mathbf{H} | \phi_j \right>
     \end{equation}

     Substituting this new notation into \ref{eq:dcoefficient} gives
     \begin{equation}
       i\hbar \dot{c_i} = \sum_j c_j \left(\mathbf{V}_{ij} - i\hbar \dot{\mathbf{R}}\cdot\mathbf{d}_{ij}(\mathbf{R}) \right)
     \end{equation}
     which can be written in terms of a state density matrix
     \begin{align}
       i\hbar a_{kl} &= c_k c_l^*\\
       i\hbar \dot{a}_{kl} &= \dot{c}_k c_l^* + c_k \dot{c}_l^* \\

     \end{align}
     where \(d_{lj}^* = -d_{jl}\) can be deduced from equation \label{eq:tullynacoupling}.

     The diagonals of \(\dot{a}_{kl}\) represents the rates at which the populations of electonic states are changing
     \begin{align}
       \dot{a}_{kk} &= -\frac{i}{\hbar}\sum_j \left[ a_{jk} (\mathbf{V}_{kj} - i\hbar \dot{\mathbf{R}} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{kj})
		      - a_{kj} ( \mathbf{V}_{kj} - i\hbar \dot{\mathbf{R}} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{jk}) \right]
     \end{align}
     Its worth looking further into these included terms,
     \begin{equation}
       b_{kj} = - \frac{i}{\hbar} \left(a_{jk} (\mathbf{V}_{kj} - i\hbar \dot{\mathbf{R}} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{kj}) - a_{kj} ( \mathbf{V}_{kj} - i\hbar \dot{\mathbf{R}} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{jk})\right)
     \end{equation}
     \(b_{kj}\) represents the net population flow from state \(j\) to state \(k\). If \(j = k \), \(b_{kj} = 0\), which means there is no self flow.
     With a little algebra, we can show that while the state density matrices are complex, the net population flows are real.
     \begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyb2a} 
       b_{kj} =
       \frac{2}{\hbar}\Im\left(a_{kj}^*\mathbf{V}_{kj}\right) - 2\Re\left(a_{kj}^*
	 \dot{\mathbf{R}} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{kj}\right).
     \end{equation}
     During dynamics, between timesteps, the system can only travel along adiabatic PES. 
     These flows must thus be converted to a probability of a hop.
     The probability of a hop from state j to k can be described as

     \begin{equation}
       \text{P}_{j \rightarrow k} = \frac{\text{Population from j to k}}{\text{Original population of j}} = \frac{b_{kj} \Delta t}{a_{jj}}
     \end{equation}

     #+begin_src latex
 Inconsistencies arise from solely using the Tully surface hopping approach.
 Trajectories transfer between  the various adiabatic potential energy surfaces instantaneously based off the QM state coefficients.
Many improvements to the surface model method has been developed since its first conception.\cite{fang1999improvement}
 These coefficients are determined using the integral of the TDSE on multiple trajectories.
 Each trajectory if unmodified will keep in phase even after spatial separation which is a non-physical occurence. \cite{joos2013decoherence,landry2011communication,nelson2013nonadiabatic}
Properly accounting for these coherences is necessary for controling charge separtion in light-harvesting devices.\cite{rozzi2013quantum}
 Furthermore, if dealing with a system with a dense electronic state structure, its likely that the ordering of these states will switch during general dynamics.
 We apply a dechohence correction as well as a trivial crossing accounting system as performed in previous research.

** THREE Quick Overview
   #+begin_src latex
   The swim-lane chart in figure \ref{scheme:nasqm} describes a common time-step that occurs within the SANDER-NEXMD interface.
   First users initiate the program through SANDER, a program found in AMBERTOOLS. SANDER uses NEXMD to calculate the energies and forces of the QM atoms, check for trivial crossings, and propagate the quantum coefficients.
   With these results, SANDER performs the QM/MM procedures to derive the accelerations and velocities for the classical time step.
   NEXMD then decides whether to perform a state transitions, adjusting the velocities as needed.
   Finally SANDER propagates the nuclear coordinates and the cycle continues for the rest of the dynamics.

** THREE Collect QM coordinates, charges, velocitie and theromostat parameters :ignore:
   #+begin_src latex

   When users initiate SANDER, they're provide the usual SANDER inputs of a
   coordinate, parameter, and sander control files.
   In addition they will include a file specific to
   NEXMD which describes the QM and Non-adiabatic behavior.
   This interface, incorporates SANDER's implementation of QM/MM as described in previous literature to generate a solvent inclusive ground state density matrix utilized by NEXMD's excited state calculations.
   Sander controls the interactions between the QM and MM regions.


   SANDER calls NEXMD providing the function calls with the QM coordinates, MM charges, and Langevin thermostat parameters.\cite{paterlini1998constant}
   NEXMD calculates the energies of the QM atoms with electrostatic interactions from the MM point charges using CIS, TDHF, or TDDFT.
   A variety of Hamiltonians are available; however, AM1 has been shown to provide very reasonable computational cost to accuracy for our systems of interest.\cite{silva2010benchmark}
   An analysis of parameter choices can be found in previous literature.\cite{nelson2012nonadiabatic}

   #+end_src
** THREE QM/MM Calculations Prior to SCF                             :ignore:
   #+begin_src latex
      We use SANDER's QM/MM implementation to provide approximations of the solvent interactions.\cite{Walker2008}
      SANDER's combined QM/MM Hamiltonian represents MM atoms as point charges and QM atoms as electronic wave-functions.
      The effective Hamiltonian uses the aforementioned hybrid approach
      \begin{equation}
	\mathbf{H}_{eff} = \mathbf{H}_{QM} + \mathbf{H}_{MM} + \mathbf{H}_{QM/MM}
      \end{equation}
      where \(\mathbf{H}_{QM}\), \(\mathbf{H}_{MM}\), \(\mathbf{H}_{QM/MM}\) are the Hamiltionians for the QM to QM, MM to MM, and QM to MM hybrid interactions.
      \(\mathbf{H}_{MM}\) is not considered during the electronic calculations due to it independence from the electronic distribution.
      \(\mathbf{H}_{QM}\) is the electronic Hamiltonian used in vacuum QM SCF calculations.
      \(\mathbf{H}_{QM/MM}\) represents the interactions between the QM charge density and MM atoms treated as point charges.
      For computational efficiency we limit the range of this interaction by a cuttoff, set by the user, generally in the range of 10-16 \(\AA\) from the paremeter QM atoms.
      For short range interactions the hybrid \(\mathbf{H}_{QM/MM}\) can be expanded into

      \begin{align}
	\mathbf{H}_{QM/MM} = &- \sum_i \sum_m q_m \hat{h}_{electron} (\vec{r}_i,  \vec{r}_m)\\
			     &+ \sum_q \sum_m q_q q_m \hat{h}_{core} (\vec{r}_q, \vec{r}_m)\\
			     &+ \sum_m \sum_q \left( \frac{A_{qm}}{r_{qm}^{12}} - \frac{B_{qm}}{r_{qm}^6} \right)
      \end{align}
      where \(i\) is the electron, \(m\) the MM atom, and \(q\) the combined nuclei and core electrons of the QM atoms.
      A and B are the Lennard-Jones interaction parameters where \(r_{qm}\) is the distance between the MM and QM atoms.
      \(q\) is the charge and \(r\) is the ccoordinate vector.
      \(\hat{h}_{core}\) represents the electronic interactions between the MM charges and the core of the QM atoms.
      \(\hat{h}_{electron}\) represents the interactions between the MM charges and either the charge density of the QM region when using Semi-emprical hamiltonians, or by using the Mulliken charges in the case of DFT.

      Long range interaction, from those outside the cutoff, considered vital for the understanding of solvent effects, are treated using SQM’s implementation of Particle Mesh Ewald.
      Trajectories use periodic boundary conditions to simulate an explicit solution, treating the system box as cells repeated infinitely many times in all directions.
      Particle Mesh Ewald calculations then determine the long-distance interactions of these periodic boxes, treating the charges and potentials in the long-range inter-box distances as sums in Fourier space treating atoms in the QM region of these calculations as Mulliken point charges.\cite{essman1995smooth}
      Once the sums are complete, SQM performs a fast Fourier transformation to obtain the long-range corrections to the energy and forces. 


      For a general timestep QM/MM interaction will be added to the density matrix as follows: 
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Calculate the MM ewald potentials using the classical charges from the MM atoms.
      \item Construct the Hamiltonian matrix as if the QM region was in vacuum.
      \item Add the one electron terms for the interaction between QM atoms and the MM atoms within the cutoff to the Hamiltonian.
      \item Within the SCF routine, copy the Hamiltonian to the fock matrix, and add the QM/MM two-electron integrals.
      \item Calculate the QM ewald potential using the iteration’s Mulliken charges, then add the ewald potentials for both QM and MM atoms to the Fock Matrix.
      \item The SCF procedure continues until convergence resulting in a density matrix that incorporates the presence of solvents. 
   \end{enumerate}

** THREE Calulation of the QM/MM forces                              :ignore:
   #+begin_src latex
   Excited-state calculations implement the Collective Electronic Oscillator (CEO) approach developed by Mukamel and coworkers, which solves the adiabatic equation of motion of a single electron density matrix.\cite{Mukamel1997,tretiak02_densit_matrix_analy_simul_elect}
   The single-electron density matrix is defined by
   \begin{equation}
     (\rho_{g\alpha})_{nm} = \left< \psi_{\alpha} (t) \right| c_m^{\dagger} c_n \left| \psi_{g} (t) \right>
   \end{equation}
   where \(\psi_g\) and \(\psi_\alpha\) are the single-electron wave functions of the ground-state and \(\alpha\) state, and \(c_m^{\dagger} c_n\) is the creation(annihilation) operator summed over the atomic orbital \(m\) and \(n\), whose size is determined by the basis set.
   The basis set coefficients of these atomic orbits are calculated in the previous SCF step and account for the presence of solvents.
   The CIS approximation is applied, creating the normalization condition 

   \begin{equation}
     \sum_{n,m} (\rho_{g\alpha})^2 = 1
   \end{equation}

   Recognizing that \(\rho_{g\alpha}\) represents the transition density from the ground to the \(\alpha\) state, we solve the Liouville equation of motion 

   \begin{align*}
     \hat{\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} = \Omega\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}
   \end{align*}


   with \(\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}\) being the two-particle Louiville operator and
   \(\Omega\) the energy difference between the \(\alpha\) state and the ground
   state. \(\rho_{0\alpha}\) is the single- electron density matrix

   \begin{align*}
     (\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha})_{nm} =  \left< \psi_{\alpha} \right| c_m^\dagger c_n \left| \psi_0 \right>.
   \end{align*}
   where \(\psi_{g}\) and \(\psi_{\alpha}\) are the single-electron wavefunctions for the groundstate and singly excited state \(\alpha\), and
   \(c_m^\dagger\) and \(c_n\) are the creation and annihilation operator respectively. The coefficients for the atomic orbital basit sets are derived prior using the QM/MM methodology from the SQM package.\cite{Walker2008} The Liouville operator can be found analytically using 

   \begin{align*}
     \hat{\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} = \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}}(\mathbf{\rho}_{00}), \mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} \right]
     + \left[ \mathbf{V}^{\vec{R}}(\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}), \mathbf{\rho}_{00} \right]
   \end{align*}

   where \(\textbf{F}^{\vec{R}}\) is the Fock operator and \(\textbf{V}^{\vec{R}}\) is the column interchange operator.

   The forces are also calculated analytically using the gradient of the ground state
   energy and the excited state energy.

   \begin{align*}
     \vec{\nabla} E_{\alpha} = \vec{\nabla} E_0 + \vec{\nabla} \Omega_{\alpha}
   \end{align*}

   With the gradient of the ground state being calculated by

   \begin{align*}
     \vec{\nabla} E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{Tr} \left[ \left( \mathbf{t}^{\vec{R}} + \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} \right) \mathbf{\rho}_{00} \right]
   \end{align*}
   where \(\textbf{t}\) is the single-electron kinetic operator.

   The gradient of the excited state can derived using

   \begin{align*}
     \vec{\nabla}\Omega_{\alpha} = \mathbf{Tr} \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} (\mathbf{\rho}_{\alpha\alpha} - \mathbf{\rho}_{00})\right]
     + \mathbf{Tr} \left[\mathbf{V}^{\vec{R}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}^\dagger \mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} \right]
   \end{align*}

   where \(\mathbf{\rho}_{ij}\) represents the density or transition density matrix for states i and
   j, \(\mathbf{F}\) is the Fock matrix and \(\mathbf{V}\) is the column interchange operator.

For non-adiabatic dynamics, the computation time seems to increase on the order of O(3) for the number of solvents and O(2) for the number of states.
The computational order on the number of solvents does is near identical for to the adiabatic since the non-adiabatic dynamics perform the same AM1 calculations.
The time order in the number of states however, differs because of the time used to calculate the non-adiabatic coupling vector and terms.

\section{Introduction}
   NEXMD is an efficient program for the simulation of photoinduced dynamics of extended conjugated molecular systems involving manifolds of coupled electronic excited states over timescales extending up to 10s of picosectonds. \cite{sifain2018photoexcited, Bjorgaard2015, case2020a, tretiak02_densit_matrix_analy_simul_elect, malone2020nexmd}
   It includes solvent effects using implicit models. These implicit solvents provide insight into the electrostatic forces, but the use of explicit solvent should provide additional information about the quantum or steric effects , allowing the simulation of electron transfer processes due to the stabilization of charge separation in the excited state.
   Many multichrormophoric molecular systems are soluble in polar solvents such as water, where such simulations could provide sought after insight into effects of charged side groups on the structural sampling, structural rearrangement, and transition density redistribution during electronic relaxation.  

   Adequate sampling of the solvent and solute configuration space, including hundreds to thousands of solvent molecules, currently cannot be achieved by QM calculations alone due to the infeasible computational cost of such extensive systems. \cite{barbatti2011nonadiabatic}
   QM/MM methods exist to allow the computationally expensive QM calculations to be performed only on the area of interest while propagating the rest of the system with cheaper classical dynamics.
   The SANDER program in the AMBER molecular dynamics package performs classical molecular dynamics with the use of periodic boundary conditions with high optimization.
   SANDER with QM/MM performs well with systems with tens of thousands of MM atoms and currently calculates QM/MM with semi-empirical Hamiltonians and DFT; however, previous versions did not provide options for excited-state MD.  

   In this work, we redirect AMBER's SANDER package from its usual semi-empirical QM package, SQM, to a modified NEXMD library.
   SANDER linked to the NEXMD library performs adiabatic dynamics at ground-state and CIS excited-state potential energy surfaces on ~100 atoms at QM and 1000s at MM.
   We apply our method to an analysis of a three-ring para-phenylene vinylene oligomer (PPV3-NO2).
   We look at how explicit solvents affect PPV3-NO2's excited state structure as well as its absorption and emission spectra.

   128 evenly spaced snapshots were collected from this simulation and used as intial conditions for another 128 individual 10ps-simulations equilibrated at 300K (NVT) using QM/MM ground state Hamiltonian.
   QM calculatations were performed using configuration interaction singles (CIS) with the AM1 hamiltonian which has previously been show to provide reasonable accuracy for computational cost. \cite{silva2010benchmark}
   QM/MM excited state molecular dynamics simulations were run during 10 ps starting from the final configuration of each of the 128 ground state QM/MM trajectores by vertical excitation to the S1 state. \cite{nelson2012nonadiabatic}
   A classical time step of 0.5 fs and a Langevin thermostat with friction constant of 2 ps-1 have been used either for ground state and excited state QMMM simulations. \cite{nelson2012nonadiabatic}
   The CIS calculations include the first of excited states of the PPV3-NO2 molecule along with the stated number of solvent molecules closest to the central benzene ring.
   We treat all other solvent molecules using classical dynamics.
   We restrict the QM solvents from drifting away from the solute and the other MM solvents from drifting closer than these QM solvents.

*** THREE Explanation of NMR Constraint figure
    #+begin_src latex
   As shown in figure \ref{fig:PPV3NO2}, the excited-state density resides towards the center of the molecule on the vinyl groups nearest to the phenyl group.
   Charge movements on solvents far from this concentration of density cause negligible energy differences.
   To maximize the utility of the QM/MM calculation, we only include the solute and the solvent molecules nearest to this central phenyl group in the QM calculations.
   To prevent these solvents from drifting during the trajectories, we implement a simple harmonic restraint using AMBER's NMR restraints.
   We select the N solvent molecules based on the proximity of the solvent atom closest to any atom located on the central benzene ring.
   We then restrain these solvents using the harmonic constraint on the distance from the center of geometry of the solvent to the center of geometry of the central phenyl group.
   We also restrain the solvent molecules not included in the QM calculation from getting closer to the central phenyl than the QM solvents, effectively making a spherical shield around the solute's central phenyl group.
   Since the distance between the center of geometries and the closest atoms are not necessarily equal, solvent atoms could initially be pushed either inside or outside this shield during the transition from MM to QM.
   However, this push only occurs during the initial equilibration of the QM ground-state calculations excluded from any analysis.
   Once the QM calculations begin, these constraints persist throughout all further calculations.
   For our CCl4 simulations with the 5 nearest solvents included (CCl4-5QM), the restriction barrier had an average radius of 6.28 \AA with the origin at the center of the central phenyl group.

        Energies, coordinates, and dipole information are acquired every ten steps.
        Equilibration times from either MM to QM state or from the S0 to S1 state range from 2-4 ps.
        We exclude the first four ps of each trajectory in the calculation of the spectra in data analysis for the absorption and emission analysis. 


    Solvents's polarizability should affect the transition dipole moments and the corresponding spectra and has been shown to experimentally. \cite{marcus1956electrostatic,martin1998hydrolysis,park2013tailored,LeDroumaguet2005}.
    Such shifts are referred to as solvatochromic shifts.
        Previous studies have analyzed solvatochromic shifts in conjugated substituted PPV3-NO2 molecules with the NEXMD program in implicit solvents.\cite{Santhanamoorthi2009}
        Results with NEXMD by TD-AM1 were redshifted from the experimental results, while single-point calculations using TD-CAM-B3LYP provided by G09 in the same implicit solvent were blue shifted.
        Other NEXMD computations have shown comparable redshifts in spectra of similar molecules in implicit solvents compared to experiment. \cite{Bjorgaard2015}
        We performed similar calculations in this paper; however, in explicit solvent.
        We compare the results to those presented in implicit solvent.

        We collect the vertical excitation dipoles and oscillator strengths between the ground state S0 and S1 every five fs during the steady-state of each trajectory to produce the absorption/emission spectra of PPV3-NO2.
        We sum over excitation states averaged over the geometries and broaden the spectra using a Gaussian bin function with FWHM=0.16 eV corresponding to a 100 fs FWHM laser excitation.
        We normalized it such that the maximum absorption is 1. 

    The broad absorption and fluorescence bands shown are a common feature of conjugated matrials due to the large geometric relaxation that occurs in the lowest excited state. \cite{bredas2009molecular}
        Figure ? presents the absorption spectra for PPV3-NO2 in select solvents and vacuum.
        The shown absorption has contributions from the nine lowest energy excited states, though the S1 state is the primary contributor to the spectra.
        We found the number of solvent molecules included in the QM region caused only minor deviations in the spectra, with the largest variance (0.02~eV) occurring between the 20QM and MM CCL4 systems, as such, in figure 12, we only present results from trajectories with 20 QM solvents.
        All solvent results are redshifted from those in vacuum matching findings in previous works.
        The absorbance within methanol and chloroform were very similar, with a peak shift from vacuum of -0.04 eV.
        Within carbon tetrachloride, this shift increases slightly more to-0.06 eV. 

        Aligning with previously reported results, the fluorescence calculations found in figure 13 show an overall more intense redshift from vacuum, along with a more significant dispersion among the solvents. \cite{Park2013}
        The smallest shift, at -0.06 eV, occurs in carbon tetrachloride, while the largest, at -0.12 eV, occurs in methanol.
        Previous works have demonstrated that the energy levels of PPV3-NO2 are further stabilized by more polar solvents, a feature clearly seen by our results.

      \label{fig:energiesAdiabatic}
    \end{minipage}\bigskip

     The absorption and the fluorescence properties are judged primarily through the difference between the ground state (S0) and the first excited state (S1) energies.
     The system starts at the S0, where it remains near the bottom of the energy well.
     Figure \ref{fig:energiesAdiabatic} shows the energies for states S0 and S1 averaged over 128 trajectories for PPV3-NO2 in CCL4 with five solvent molecules included in the QM calculations.
     During the first six ps, the system runs on the ground-state S0, and the S0 energies stay near the minimum with small oscillations caused by temperature.
     At the time 0 ps, the system instantaneously hops to the S1 potential energy surface.
     The average energy difference at t=0 between S0 and S1 is 2.93 eV, and it corresponds reasonably well with the peak of the absorption spectrum.
     When the system relaxes on the new surface, the S1 and S0 energies decrease and increase respectively, until the difference between the two is 2.50 eV agreeing with the peak found in the fluorescence spectra.
     Table ? presents the fitted decay of S1 energies using   

    \begin{equation}
    E = E_d \text{e}^{-t/\tau} + c

    Immediately after excitation from the ground A\(_g\) to the first excited state with B\(_u\) symmetry, the \(\pi\) bond along the vinylene segment encourages PPV\(_3\)-NO\(_2\) to a planar configuration.
    We use the torsion angle around the vinylene segments as the slow nuclear coordinates of PPV\(_3\)-NO\(_2\)
    following precendent. \cite{Clark2012}
    The torsion angle around the vinylene segments have been shown to be highly coupled to the excited state.\cite{nelson2011nonadiabatic,panda2013electronically}
    In PPV3-NO2 systems, the excitation to S1 leads to relaxation towards a nearly planar structure Torsion angle around d1,d3 and d4,d6 are averaged over 128 trajectories to produce the near and far torsion angle data respectively. \cite{barford2011ultrafast}

    For our CCl4-5QM example, the dihedral angle around the near set d1 to d2 equilibrates around 23° and 12° in the S0 and S1 states, respectively.
    For the near set, d4 to d6, these values are 23° and 15°.
    Once again, only a noticeable difference in S1.
    The time constants for the S1 dihedral relaxations are around 0.8 ps.
    Relaxation of the dihedral angles occurs by four ps. 

    Table 5 shows a summary of the torsion angles analysis of all tested solvents after five ps of relaxation after the jump to the first excited state.
    The trajectories include 20 solvent molecules within the QM calculations.
    A noticeable shift towards a planar geometry occurs in all solvents.
    This shift is greatest near the nitro group.

            \subsection{Bond Length Alternation}
       In \(\pi\) conjugated compounds, the electrons unevenly distribute across the carbon-carbon \(\pi\) bonds causing a dimerization or alternation of single-like carbon bonds and double-like carbon bonds.
    When promoted from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LOMO), the bonding-antibonding pattern switches, and the electron densities correspondingly adjust.
    As a result the single-like carbons become more double-like and vice versa. \cite{bredas1999excited}
                This structural difference between the excited-state and ground-state of PPV3-molecules are presented clearly by distortions in the C=C and C-C bonds found in the vinylene segment.\cite{tretiak02_densit_matrix_analy_simul_elect, karabunarliev2000rigorous, karabunarliev2000adiabatic, nelson2014nonadiabatic}
                These distortions can be measure by bond length alternation (BLA)

                \begin{equation}
                \frac{d_i + d_e}{2} - d_e,
                \end{equation}

                where \(d_i\) and \(d_e\) are the interior and exterior bonds, and \(d_c\) is the central bond.
                This value represents the differences between the double and single bonds of the vinylene sections.
                The BLA is a descriptor for \(\pi\) bond distributions. \cite{tretiak2002conformational}
                In this system, we analyze the BLAs of two separate bond sets, the bonds d1-3 (near-set) and d4-6 (far-set) seen in Scheme 2.

                Figure \ref{fig:bla_adiabatic} show the bond length alternation of PPV3-NO2 in various solvents during the S1 trajectories where the dashed lines represent equilibrated ground state values which are near 0.110 Å for sets d1-3 and d4-6 regardless of solvent enviornment.
                Within the first couple hundred femtoseconds after the excitation to S1, the central bonds expand, while the interior and exterior bonds contract.
                For all solvent environments, this bond restructuring is amplified by close proximity to the amino group, where we see an average drop of 0.07 Å in sets d1-3 compared to a 0.04 Å drop in sets d4-6.
                The strength of this amplification is dependent on the solvent environment where the BLA difference between the far and near sets PP3-NO2 in methanol, 0.034 Å, surpases that found in carbon tetrachloride, 0.022 Å.

                Table 2 presents further details of the S1 BLA simulation.
                In all cases, the exterior bond (d1 and d4) becomes slightly longer than the interior bond (d3 and d6).
                The BLAs from the near and far sets therefore split.
                In the near set, the S0 and S1 BLA converge to 0.1091 Å and 0.00453 Å, respectively.
                In the far set, these numbers are 0.1103 Å and 0.0697 Å, respectively.
                The smaller bond length spread in the near set, along with the lower BLA, suggests more delocalization on those bonds than in the far set. 

                The number of solvents included in the QM calculations had little effect on the convergence of the distances or BLA.
                PPV3-NO2 had similar ground state BLAs of around 0.11 Å for both near and far sets matching results on similar systems regardless of the solvent. \cite{nelson2011nonadiabatic}
                The information presented is averaged over time after relaxation across all trajectories.
                The S1 BLAs varied between the solvents and with the distance away from the NO2 group.
                Among the selected solvents, CH3OH has the smallest near set S1 BLA and largest far set S1 BLA.
                CCl4 has the largest near set S1 BLA, and also the smallest far set S1 BLA and has close to vacuum-like behavior.
                The CH3OH solvent seems to enlarge the BLA changes from the ground to excited states.

	The significant effects of S0-S1 transitions on the Cartesian measurement of BLA encourages the analysis of these bonds' quantum mechanical behavior.
	Because the double bonds elongated and the single-bonds contracted, we expect the single-bonds to gain a partial double-bond character and vice versa.
	Simple bond ordering does not consider these subtleties of a quantum electronic wave-function.
	Fortunately, the quantum mechanical descriptor, Wiberg bond index, provides a reasonable analogy of the classical Lewis structure a chemist would expect.
	Wiberg bond indexes are calculated from the density matrix by 

	\begin{equation}
	W_{AB} = \sum_{\mu\in A}\sum_{\nu \in B} | D_{\mu\nu} |^2
	\end{equation}

	where \(A\) and \(B\) are indexes of the two atoms, \(\mu\) and \(\nu\) are the atomic orbitals, and \(D\) is the density matrix.
	The method sums the electron density shared by both atoms.
	If an electron if fully localized on a single atom, the sum of the elements equals zero providing a value that matches our intuition of a bond. 

	As the bond order increases, we expect the bond to become more rigid and the bond length to shrink.
	Figure \ref{fig:bondOrdersAdiabatic} displays the bond order of bonds d1-6 for PPV3-NO2 in CCl4 with 5 QM solvent molecules.
	At time t=0, the system instantaneously transitions to the first excited state, S1.
	The Wiberg bond index then uses the density matrix for S1, leading to a sudden shift in its value.
	At S1, the bond orders of d2 and d5 instantaneously drop, and expansion of their bond lengths soon follows.
	The larger shifts in the near set correspond to the information found in the BLA analysis.
	The interior bonds, d1 and d4, have lower bond indexes than their exterior counterparts, d3 and d6.

*** THREE Conclusion
    #+begin_src latex
    The Non-adiabatic Excited State Molecular Dynamics package (NEXMD) that SANDER is linked to for the excited state calculations done in this paper is designed to perform molecular dynamics simulations outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximations using the FSSH in implicit solvents.
    The program has been tested well and is helpful in gaining insights into the dynamics of molecules prone to photo-excitations.
    However, simulations in explicit solvents have been shown to produce qualitatively different results than in implicit solvent mediums.
    By linking AMBER's SANDER to NEXMD, we produced a quick and efficient tool to simulate explicit solvent behavior on adiabatic excited state dynamics.

    initial conditions for an additional 4ps using the AM1 semiempical Hamiltonian
    Born-Oppenheimer on the molecules to be included in future QM calculations to
    allow the system to relax. The 4 ps timescale was determined using the
    information form the previous paper. The simulations were described the Langevin
    equations at a temperature set to 300 K with the Langevin friction parameter set
    to 2 ps\(^{-1}\). The final frames of these QM trajectories were then used as the
    initial conditions for the following pulse pump calculations.

 Pump-Probe Spectroscopy is an experimental technique commonly performed in the
 study of ultrafast electonic statte dynamics. In the case of conjugated polymers
 in can be used to study the localized excictronic transitions that are
 accessible through an excitation from the S1 state but not the ground state S0.
 To simulate this behavior, we take the final snapshot of the QM ground state
 calculations and perform a single point calculation at the S1 state to find the
 next state with the highest oscillator strength.

**** THREE How to choose excited states.
    :LOGBOOK:
    - Note taken on [2021-01-30 Sat 13:41] \\
      - During photo excitation we need to choose the proper optically allowed and probable states.
      - These initial excited states are determined using the Frank-Condon method
      - Fire a 4.3 eV laser with FWHM of 100fs^-1 or 0.162eV corresponds to a spectral broadening of 0.0687eV.
    :END:
    #+begin_src latex
    The unnormalized probabilities are determined using
    \begin{equation}
      P'(\Omega_e) = f_{ge}(\Omega_e) \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp \left[ - \frac{(\Omega_e - \Omega)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right]
    \end{equation}
    where \(\Omega\) is the energy of the laser exciatation, \(\Omega_\alpha\) the energy difference from the first excited state to the possible future excited state \(\alpha\), \(f_{ge}(\Omega_e)\) is oscillator strength for the transition, and \(\sigma\) the spectral broadening.  

    The probability of initially populating an excited state \(\alpha\) is then
    \begin{equation}
      P(\Omega_\alpha) = \frac{P'(\Omega_i)}{\sum_i P'(\Omega_i)}
    \end{equation}

    The states are then chosen randomly using these weights.

       - Figure \ref{s1absorptions} visually describes the absorption spectra from the S1 state, using the energies from the ground state.
       - Spectra for the lowest 10 states were normalized.
       - The right side shows the gaussian waveform used for excitation.
       - Stronger overlap and intensity with S9 leads to roughly 80-90% initial population of S9 and 10-20% population of S10.
       - Methanol solvent redshift the spectra
       - Similar redshifts were detected in the adiabatic simulations.
       - The addition of solvents into the QM region had little effect on the shift.
     :END:
#+begin_src latex
Figure \ref{s1absorption} shows the absorption spectra observerd from state S1 as energy differences from the ground state.
Spectras were normalized over both states.
The intensity of state S10 is noticeably lower than that from S9, while the peak of S9 is more aligned, as such the we expect the initial population after excitation to heavily weighed toward S9, which we see.
Spectras for varying number of solvents included in the QM region as well as vacuum are shown.
A gaussian laser wavefunction with energy of 4.3 eV with FWHM of 0.16 eV is shown above the top chart.
The presence of solvent redshift the peak absorption spectra by roughly 0.1 eV similar to what was seen in the adiabatic spectra analysis.

  Figure \ref{fig:stateDecay} shows the population of each state calculated as
  the number of trajectories at the state's potential energy surface over the
  total number of trajectories. S\(_m\) represents the initial state calculated using
  the pulse pump calculations previously done. States S\(_7\) and S\(_9\) are included as
  the only other "slow" states, or states that reached a population of more than
  0.05. The other states were excluded from the graph. These charts show that the
  addition of the NO\(_2\) oligimors dramatically speed up the state relaxation. S\(_m\)
  ranged from S\(_9\) to S\(_15\) for PPV\(_3\) and S\(_11\) to S\(_21\) for PPV\(_{3}\)-NO\(_{2}\). Figure
  ref:fig:s1-populations, shows the rise of the S\(_{1}\) populations over the first
  500 fs after excitation. We model these rises by fitting the curves to the
  function
  \begin{equation}
  f(t) = \frac{Ae^{t/\tau}}{A+e^{t/\tau}} - \frac{A}{1+A}
  \end{equation}
  where $t$ is time, $\tau$ is the relaxation, and $A$ is a constant that
  normalizes such that the populations remain between 0 and 1. The results are displayed in ref:table:s1. 
  We clearly see that adding a test for trivial-nonavoided crossing slows the rate
  of relaxation from a time constant of 258~fs. This is to be expected since we
  are now preventing transitions (mostly downward) that should not occur. The
  methanol have mixed results with regards to PPV3 and seem to slightly slow the
  relaxation of PPV\(_3\)-NO\(_2\). Experiments using ultrafast spectroscopy have shown that
  for PPV thin films the time constant for relaxations should be around 200 fs.
  However, that was on thin films and for PPV\(_3\), the energy gap !! Average S\(_1\) ->
  S\(_m\) energy gap) than in the thin film (0.8eV). Previous research using the
  NAESMD framework have shown a time constant of 394 fs, but this was without the
  test for trivial non-avoided crossings.

Reported energies are in respect to the ground state energies at the initial step.
The initial relaxation rates up to aroun 100 fs, are similar in all instances.
Over time, the rate in vacuum seems to slow quicker than in solvent.
The energy in solvent also equilibrat at around 0.2 eV higher than the solvent.
No noticiable differences can be decerned between the inclusion of 5 or 10 solvents in the QM region.

Figure \ref{fig:dihedralNonadiabatic} presents the torsional angles around d1,d2,d3 (Near) and d4,d5,d6 (Far).
Similar to what was reported in the adiabatic simulations, the angles reported in vacuum remain rougly 5\(^\circ\) higher than those reported in the methanol solution.
Relaxation in the methanol solution is slightly quick than in vacuum.
Then equilibrated torsional angle in the full MM solvent could possibly be a few degrees higher than in the mixed QM/MM solvents.
Relaxations are faster, and approach a lower minimum near the nitrate group.

#+begin_src latex
The visual analysis of the Widberg bond orders can be found in figure \ref{fig:bondOrderNonadiabatic}.
The outer bonds d1,d3,d4,d6 slowly rise and gain more double bond characteristics while the inner bonds d2 and d5 lower and gain more single bond characteristics.
Little solvent effect can be descerned for the bond furthest from the nitrate group d4,d5,d6.
Noticeable solvent effects exist in the group nearest the nitrate group, with the solvent apparently amplifying the effect found in vacuum.
The inclusion of solvent in the QM region has relatively negligible effects on the bond order compared to the addition of MM solvents.
These results align well with what was found in the analysis for the bond length alternation.

** ONE Summary
** ONE Future Works
#+begin_src latex
We presented a method the integrated the excited state non-adiabatic dynamics capabilities of NEXMD with the QM/MM periodic box solvent simulation capabilities found in SANDER.
We demonstrate how certain solvents can be included in the QM region and restrained near the solvent.
We perform our new methodology on the organic conjugated molecule PPV\(_3\)-NO\(_2\).
We analyze the effects that the addition of solvents have on the steady state absorption and fluorescence of PPV\(_3\)-NO\(_2\) in various solvents with differing dielectric constants and found that the addition of solvents to the QM region blueshifted the absorption and redshifted the fluorescence.

Future work can done to implement a QM/MM approach using recent classical dynamics functionality employing machine learning algorithms such as ANI.
The calculation of the non-adiabatic coupling terms is the bottleneck in most of these non-adiabatic trajectories, as such work into predicting these terms using supervised learning approaches is encouraged.
The scripts used to model the simulations done in this paper are extensive and the work to make them user friendly should be continued.
