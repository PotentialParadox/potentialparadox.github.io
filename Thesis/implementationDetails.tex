\section{Introduction to AMBER and NEXMD}

NEXMD, currently being developed by the Tretiak lab in los Alamos, has a proven track record of performance on the stimulation of ultra-fast non-adiabatic behaviors.
It’s ability to solve state coupling equations on-the-fly has found great utility for systems with hundreds of atoms.
Numerous studies have implemented the method for research into topics including the study of chlorophyll organic conjugated molecules, and pi conjugated macrocycles. \cite{zheng2017photoinduced, nelson2014nonadiabatic, alfonso2016interference} 
Such studies with NEXMD have been limited to implicit solvents.
No method to provide NEXMD with QM/MM capabilities have yet to be implemented.

Amber is primarily known as a classical force-field molecular dynamics package.
It’s a massive project maintained by people across the globe that's been designed to work with very large systems ranging in the tens of thousands of atoms. \cite{case2020a}
Amber is capable of a huge range of simulations from replica exchange to QM/MM umbrella sampling using nudge elastic bands. \cite{cruzeiro2020exploring, ghoreishi2019fast}
Most importantly for this research, it has a proven track record of doing QM/MM solvent-solute simulations using periodic boundary conditions.
