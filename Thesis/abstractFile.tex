We present a method to link the Non-adiabatic-Excited-state Molecular Dynamics (NEXMD) package to the SANDER package supplied by AMBERTOOLS, to provide excited-state adiabatic QM/MM simulations.
NEXMD is a computational package particularly developped to perform simulations of the photoexcitation and subsequent nonadiabatic electronic and vibrational energy relaxation and redistribution in large multichormophoric conjugated molecules, a process that involves several coupled electronic excited states.
In this work, we use it solely for its capability to perform excited-state adiabatic dynamics.
In this report, we first describe the basic methodology behind the code, where we briefly describe the general principals behind excited state adiabatic dynamics simulations performed in NEXMD and the QM/MM calculations performed by SANDER.
We outline the flowchart connecting them in order to optimize their exchange allowing excited state adiabatic dynamics simulations of large conjugated materials in explicit solvent.
To validate functionality, we analyze the dynamics of a polyphenylene vinylene oligomer (PPV3-NO2) in vacuum and various explicit solvents.
We highlight the system's ability to generate optical spectrum, view state-dependent conformational changes, and view quantum bond orderings.
