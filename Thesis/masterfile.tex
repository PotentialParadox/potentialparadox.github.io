%%% For each of the following, type in the name of the file that contains each section. 
%       They are assumed to be tex files, but if they aren't the command takes an optional argument for the extension.
%       So, you could load dedication.tex as your dedication file using \setDedicationFile{dedication}
%       You could load dedication.txt instead with \setDedicationFile[txt]{dedication}.
%       NOTE: For some compilers they may or may not add a .tex to the end of the file automatically.
%           If you get a "couldn't find dedication.tex.tex" type error, try the command with an empty optional argument,
%           e.g. \setDedicationFile[]{dedication}
%%%

%%% These are REQUIRED sections; easiest to do via these commands.

\setDedicationFile{dedicationFile}%                 Dedication Page
\setAcknowledgementsFile{acknowledgementsFile}%     Acknowledgements Page
\setAbstractFile{abstractFile}%                     Abstract Page (This should only include the abstract itself)
\setReferenceFile{referenceFile}{amsplain}%         References. First argument is your bibtex source file
%                                                       the second argument is your bibtex style file.
\setBiographicalFile{biographyFile}%                Biography file of the Author (you).

%%% These are NOT required, so only use them if you actually need/have them.

% \setAbbreviationsFile{abbreviations}%           Abbreviations Page
% \setAppendixFile{appendix}%                     Appendix Content; hyperlinking might be weird.
% \multipleAppendixtrue%                          Uncomment this if you have more than one appendix,

%%%% Here you just need to include/input your actual work. 
%       The above files (dedication, acknowledgement, titlepage, etc etc) will all be added for you 
%       using the files you assigned above. 
%       If you want to input the above files manually you can comment out the \setFILE command above 
%       and use \input or \include here. Generally you want to use \include to get your pagebreak.
%       NOTE: If you input manually you will have to do some/all the formatting manually.

\include{theoreticalMethods}% Modified from old template.

% \begin{algorithm}% Example showing the weird "algorithm" environment works...
%     \captionof{algorithm}{Test Caption}

% \addObject{TestStuff!}%     This is probably the command that a normal author will use to add objects.

% \chapter{EXAMPLES OF EDITOR/Author TOOLS, TABLES, AND IMAGES}% Notice that we can use chapter/section etc breaks in the master file if we want, and then use \input instead of \include to avoid unneccessary page breaks.
% \input{editorAndAuthorRemarks}%     Stuff about using editorRemark and authorRemark commands
% \input{includingTablesExamples}%    Stuff about using Tables.
% \input{includingImagesExamples}%    Stuff about using Images.
