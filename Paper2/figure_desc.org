* Populations [2/2]
** DONE Vacuum
Shown below are the population trajectories for PPV_3 and PPV_{3}-NO_{2} in
vacuum. States with very short lifespans were dropped for clarity.
*** DONE PPV_3-No-Trivial
Using no trivial crossing and basic decoherence, the population plot looks very
similar to that found in Tammie's thesis

** DONE S1 vs Time
   CLOSED: [2020-05-01 Fri 14:26]
To the following graphs we fitted a function
$\frac{Ae^{t/\tau}}{A+e^{t/\tau}} - \frac{A}{1+A}$
to produce the accompanying tables, where $\tau$ is the time constant, and A
normalizing factor restricting the S_1 population from becoming greater than 1.
