* Introduction
Because there's such a strong coupling between the vibration excite Electronics
states of freedom mechanic molecules we must take into account not a tea bag
Dynamics in order to produce reasonable simulations. We cannot assume that the
nuclear coordinates are significantly slower than that of the electrons

This type of research we have a ground thing above the ground state dim sleep
populated manifold of excited States state board often swapping energy in other
words the energy of one state at will be higher than another state at one point
then at a later time the energy of that first date could be visited the energy
of the other ones so we must all think you track of the order of the states. As
a general rule we also need to be solving the structure ecrater the creation on
the Fly for each electronic level . Calculating the potential energy surfaces
for all these dates is quite complex and requires solutions to the shrinker
equation the backend methods used to calculate these put the Chinese Services
can range to externally complicated density functional Theory methods to others
much more simplified to me empirical methods effort must be made to balance
accuracy to efficiency in this regards.

Hamacas that we're using have a high energy barrier between the ground state in
the first excited States which matches up with Kasha’s rule.

The characteristics of this electronic manifold overtime to be very useful to a
multiple of different you scenarios such as the residence in which we care
deeply about the molecules lowest level excited state or in light harvesting
Light-harvesting applications and where the molecule excitation energy is being
transferred to charge separation. The study of photosynthesis can also be how to
buy this type of research that focuses on the non-radiative crossings The ground
state.

Ton of research has gone in the study and he's not on a team that is molecular
Dynamics methodologies methodologies range from the extremely complicated
inexpensive approaches such as I can figure is time-dependent Arkansas cabin air
show for methods and Quantum movies The are quite similar ones such as ehrenfest
Theory but the ones that this paper focuses on is specifically the toy surface
hopping methodology used with a package, the not adiabatic said America the
Dynamics package developed at Los Alamos.

Anon idiopathic excited state Dynamics program has until recently been used only
in implicit solvents or an explicit song fence without any type of Nadia body
Dynamics only in the excited first excited States. in this paper we propose a
method to extend the capabilities of the non adiabatic cold using the Amber
package and its ability to do q m m m Dynamics and boxes.

Are focuses on organic conjugated molecule specifically ppv 3 and PPP 2 as shown
in the diagram.
* Theoretical Methodology
** Adiabatic Motion
To find the excited state energies during dynamics, we calculate the Liouville
eigenvalue equation

\begin{align*}
  \hat{\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} = \Omega\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}
\end{align*}

with \(\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}\) being the two-particle Louiville operator and
\(\Omega\) the energy difference between the \(\alpha\) state and the ground
state, where the Liouville operator can be found analytically by

\begin{align*}
  \hat{\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} = \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}}(\mathbf{\rho}_{00}), \mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} \right]
  + \left[ \mathbf{V}^{\vec{R}}(\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}), \mathbf{\rho}_{00} \right]
\end{align*}

and the single electron density matrix for each state of the system is described by

\begin{align*}
  (\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha})_{nm} =  \left< \psi_{alpha} \right| c_m^\dagger c_n \left| \psi_0 \right>.
\end{align*}

The excited state inter-qm region gradients are found by adding the transition
energies gradients to the ground state gradients, where the transition energy
gradients are

The forces are then calculated analytically by the gradient of the ground state
energy and the excited state energy.

\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla} E_{\alpha} = \vec{\nabla} E_0 + \vec{\nabla} \Omega_{\alpha}
\end{align*}

With the gradient of the ground state being calculated by

\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla} E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{Tr} \left[ \left( \mathbf{t}^{\vec{R}} + \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} \right) \mathbf{\rho}_{00} \right]
\end{align*}

and the gradient of the excited state being

\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla}\Omega = \mathbf{Tr} \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} (\mathbf{\rho}_{\alpha\alpha} - \mathbf{\rho}_{00})\right]
  + \mathbf{Tr} \left[\mathbf{V}^{\vec{R}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}^\dagger \mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} \right]
\end{align*}

where \(\mathbf{\rho}_{ij}\) represents the density or transition density matrix for states i and
j, \( \mathbf{F} \) is the Fock matrix,  \( \mathbf{t} \) is the kinetic operator acting on
one-electron and \( \mathbf{V} \) is the column interchange operator.
** Non-Adiabatic
As each trajectory moves along its potential energy surface, we will consistently check to determine whether a state transition to occur.
We do so by solving the time dependent Schrodinger equation numerically.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyHamiltonian} \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{T}_{R} +
  \mathbf{H}_{0}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{R})
\end{equation}
where the matrix elements of the electron Hamiltonian are

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyVelements}
  V_{ij}(\mathbf(R))=\left<\phi_i(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\right|\mathbf{H}_{0}\left.(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\phi_j(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\right>
\end{equation}
We define the non-adiabatic coupling vector as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullynacoupling} \mathbf{d}_{ij}\mathbf(R) =
  \left<\phi_{i}(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\right|\mathbf{\nabla}_{\mathbf{R}}\left.\phi_j(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\right>
\end{equation}
We recall that the total wave function can be expanded into a linear
sum of slaterdeterninants.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:psiexpansion} \Psi(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{R},t) =
  \sum_jc_j(t)\phi_j(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R}) = c_j\left|\phi_j\right>
\end{equation}
If we take equation \ref{eq:psiexpansion} and place it into the time
independent Schrodinger's equation,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyS1} i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial
    t}c_j\left|\phi_j\right> = \mathbf{H} c_j \left|\phi_j\right>
\end{equation}
We can then apply the chain rule, and multiply each side on the left
by $\left<\right. \phi \left|\right.$ giving,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyS2}
  \left<\phi_k\right|i\hbar\left(c_j\left|\right.\dot{\phi}_j\left.\right>+\dot{c}_j\left|\phi_j\right>\right)=\left<\phi_k\right|\mathbf{H}c_j\left|\phi_j\right>
\end{equation}
Recognizing that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyS3}
  \left<\phi_k\right|\dot{\phi}_j\left.\right>=\left<\phi_k\right|\frac{d\mathbf{R}}{dt}\frac{d}{d\mathbf{R}}\left|\phi_j\right>=\dot{\mathbf{R}}\cdot\mathbf{d}_{kj}(\mathbf{R})
\end{equation}
equation \ref{eq:tullyS2} simplifies to

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyS4}
  i\hbar\left(c_j\dot{\mathbf{R}}\cdot\mathbf{d}_{kj}+\dot{c}_j\delta_{kj}\right)
  = c_jV_{kj} \rightarrow i\hbar\dot{c}_k =
  c_j\left(V_{kj}-i\hbar\dot{\mathbf{R}}\cdot\mathbf{d}_{kj}\right)
\end{equation}
If we multiply equation \ref{eq:tullyS4} by $i \hbar \dot{c_{k}}$ and
subtract from that its complex conjugate multiplied by $i\hbar c_{k}$,
we get
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyDF2}
  i\hbar\dot{a}_{kl}=a_{jl}\left(V_{kj} - i\hbar \dot{\mathbf{R}} \cdot
    \mathbf{d}_{kj} \right) - a_{kj} \left(V_{jl} - i\hbar \dot{\mathbf{R}}
    \cdot \mathbf{d}_{jk} \right)
\end{equation}
where $a_{jl}$ are the density matrix components described by $a_{jl}=c_j^*c_l$.
Our focus in the paper will be on the diagonal elements of $a$,
which represent the population densities, that can be convenient
summarize as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullya2b} \dot{a}_{kk} = \sum_{l\ne
    k}b_{kl},
\end{equation}
where

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyb2a} b_{kj} =
  \frac{2}{\hbar}\Im\left(a_{kj}^*V_{kj}\right) - 2\Re\left(a_{kj}^*
    \dot{\mathbf{R}} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{kj}\right)
\end{equation}
This should be read as the rate of change of the kth state population
is equal to the sum of the changes from the lth state to the kth
state.
The nonadiabatic coupling term $\mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{kj}$ is calculated analytically ``on the fly''.\cite{Nelson2014}\cite{Tommasini2001}\cite{Chernyak2000}\cite{Send2010}
As an example, lets say we have two states $1$ and $2$.
If we choose a small enough time step, the change in population will be
approximately the rate the rate of change, and

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullya2g} \frac{a_{11}(t=\Delta t) -
    a_{11}(t= 0)}{a_{11}(t=\Delta t)} \approx
  \frac{\dot{a}_{22}(t=0)\Delta t}{a_{11}(t=0)} =
  \frac{b_{21}(t=0)\Delta t}{a_{11}(t=0)} = g_{12}
\end{equation}
for small $\Delta t$.  $g_{12}$ is defined as the probability of
moving from state 1 to state 2 in the current time step.  We next
create a random number $\zeta$ A switch from step 1 to 2 will occur if

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyjump1} \zeta < g_{12}
\end{equation}
Larger jumps are possible.  Generally, a switch from state i, to k will occur if

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyjump2} \sum_{j=1}^{k-1}g_{ij} < \zeta
  \le \sum_{j=1}^{k}g_{ij}
\end{equation}

* Computational Timings
* Simulation Methods
[[./scripted_diagrams/simulations-1.png]]
** Ground State Sampling
We equilibrated the system to a temperature set to 300K. To collect a broad
enough sampling, we sampled from a 1024 ps, with a 0.5 fs timestep fully
classical trajectories using the AMBER force field. We performed a separate
trajectory for each situation combination of solute / with solvent including
whether the solvent was included in the QM calculations. We had a total of 6
separate 1024 ps classical trajectories, PPV3 in Vacuum, CH_3OH, and 5QM CH_3OH
and PPV_3-NO_2 in Vacuum, CH_3OH, and 5QM CH_3OH. 1024 snapshots where taken at
1ps, 2ps .. 1024ps. We used the final frame of those tranjectories as the
initial conditions for an additional 4ps using the AM1 semiempical Hamiltonian
Born-Oppenheimer on the molecules to be included in future QM calculations to
allow the system to relax. The 4 ps timescale was determined using the
information form the previous paper. The simulations were described the Langevin
equations at a temperature set to 300 K with the Langevin friction parameter set
to 20 ps^{-1}. The final frames of these QM trajectories were then used as the
initial conditions for the following pulse pump calculations.
** Pulse Pump Calculations
*** Explain the pulse pump experiment
Pump-Probe Spectroscopy is and experimental technique commonly performed in the
study of ultrafast electonic statte dynamics. In the case of conjugated polymers
in can be used to study the dlocalized excictronic tranisions that are
accessible through and excitation of the S1 state but not the ground state S0.
To simulate this behavior, we take the final snapshot of the QM ground state
calculations and perform a single point calculation at the S1 state to find the
next state with the highest oscillator strength.
*** TODO Excited State Density Chart
We looked specifically for a large peak in oscillator strength, at least twice
the amount of any other. Those trajectories that failed to meet those conditions
were filtered out from the following calculations. We recorded the successful
state transitions and used them for the S_m state tully excited state
calculations dynamics.
** S_m Non Adiabatic Dynamics
Using the same snapshot used for the Pulse Pump calculations and their
corresponding trajectories, we used the previously calculated state from the
pulse pump as our initial state and perform a 500 fs dyanmics with timestep of
0.5 fs, and nuclear coordinate dyanmics described by the Langevin dynamics with
temperature set to 300K and friction set to 20^{-1}. The dyanmics were allowed
to behave non-adiabatically and we tested for trivial unavoided crossing between
excited states.The dynamics did not include QM ewald.

 Figure ref:fig:all-populations shows the population of each state calculated as
 the number of trajectories at the state's potential energy surface over the
 total number of trajectories. S_m represents the initial state calculated using
 the pulse pump calculations previously done. States S_7 and S_9 are included as
 the only other "slow" states, or states that reached a population of more than
 0.05. The other states were excluded from the graph. These charts show that the
 addition of the NO_2 oligimors dramatically speed up the state relaxation. S_m
 ranged from S_9 to S_15 for PPV_3 and S_11 to S_21 for PPV_{3}-NO_{2}. Figure
 ref:fig:s1-populations, shows the rise of the S_{1} populations over the first
 500 fs after excitation. We model these rises by fitting the curves to the
 function
 \begin{equation}
 f(t) = \frac{Ae^{t/\tau}}{A+e^{t/\tau}} - \frac{A}{1+A}
 \end{equation}
 where $t$ is time, $\tau$ is the relaxation, and $A$ is a constant that
 normalizes such that the populations remain between 0 and 1. The results are displayed in ref:table:s1. 
 We clearly see that adding a test for trivial-nonavoided crossing slows the rate
 of relaxation from a time constant of 258~fs. This is to be expected since we
 are now preventing transitions (mostly downward) that should not occur. The
 methanol have mixed results with regards to PPV3 and seem to slightly slow the
 relaxation of PPV3-NO_2. Experiments using ultrafast spectroscopy have shown that
 for PPV thin films the time constant for relaxations should be around 200 fs.
 However, that was on thin films and for PPV_3, the energy gap !! Average S_1 ->
 S_m energy gap) than in the thin film (0.8eV). Previous research using the
 NAESMD framework have shown a time constant of 394 fs, but this was without the
 test for trivial non-avoided crossings.

  [[./Images/population_fit_tabulation/s1.png]]

** Potential Energies
The potential energies averaged over !!N-PPV3!! and !!N-PPV3-NO2!! completed
trajectories are shown in figures ref:fig:ppv3-potential and
ref:fig:ppv3-no2-potential. The corresponding S_0 and S_1 states are shown for
comparison and are the last 500 fs of a 10 ps run for each of those states. As
the initial S_m trajectories reduce the potential energies reduce towards the
corresponding S_1 steady state energies. From figure
ref:fig:ppv3-no2-s1-populations, we can see that by 400 fs, most of the population
in the PPV_{3}-NO_{2} trajectories are on the S_1 potential energy surface.
After 400ps, any reduction in the potential energy is due to adiabatic
relaxation. We include for comparison in figure ref:fig:ppv3-potential the
potential energy relaxation form the initial S_m trajectories without using a
test for trivial unavoided crossings tracking the spacialization of the
electronic transitions as implemented by the Tretiak group labeled (S_{m} Vacuum
NT). By taking into account a test for trivial non-avoided crossings, we see a
notable reduction in the rate of relaxation. This matches what we see in the
growth of the S_1 populations as seen in ref:fig:ppv3-s1-populations, where
without the tests for trivial crossings, the S_1 state rises much quicker. 

The energies between the solvent and vacuum. The potential energie of the solute
in vacuum is noticablly smaller than in vacuum as to be expected. The rate of
relaxation in methanol for PPV_3-NO_2 is slightly faster than in vacuum, but
negligable in the case PPV_3. Adding the 5 solvents to the calculation did not
seem to result in any noticable differences in regards to the potential energy
relaxation rate for either PPV_3 or PPV_{3}-NO_{2}. There's a larger difference
between the S_1 relaxed potential energies for PPV_{3{-NO_2 than there is at the
initial S_{m} states.

** Bond Length Adjustment
In figure [[ref:fig:bla-vacuum]], the BLA for both PPV_3 and PPV_{3}-NO_{2} in
vacuum the ground state varies very little the two. We use shades of red the
display the ground-state and shades of green to represent states that start in
S_m and shades of blue the describe a first excited state trajectores. The
ground state has very little variation. The first excited state splits in PPV_{3}-NO_{2},
with the Far Side being described as being the furthest from the Nitro goup.  
States SM and state S1 the atom group further from the Nitro group had a more
distinct variation than the bla with the groups nearest the Nitro group The
variation is most distinct and the first excited States the difference between
the them on the S_m closed group is very much smaller and similar to what we found in
the The potential Energies The Barley the Judgment relaxation, and ppb 3 ml to
is significantly faster than that time of PPP. The ground-state energy that we
found matches values performed from the previous research by Tammie as does the
S5 started to take pla Big billy for the states for the trajectories that
started in the initial M States showed a slider longer time for relaxation than
that found and Tammy's research. FIXME I need to add Tammy's ballet data to the
Bone length adjustment. The very quick relaxation of the bla in the states
suggest that very quickly after the initial excitation, PPV_{3}-NO_{2} quickly
stabilizes and flattens within first 500 fs. Later we will compare this
to the dihedral angle to see if this matches our expectations. Previous research
has shown that after this acceptation an actual Bond indices at the Scribe by
the Wydber index shrinks well showing that the single bonds gain a significant
amount double bond characteristics causing the molecule to Stiffen.

*** Why do we want to do dihedral angels?

*** Description of the plot
**** Lines are drawn to help guide the eye
**** The S_1 and S_0 state plotted are from previous research
**** Red is ground, Blue is S_1, Green is S_m
**** S_m refers to trajectories that started after the pulse pump
*** Inital Dihedral angle for S_m is lower than ground state
**** Visual analysis as to why
**** Previous paper have found that initial torsional angles strongly determine vertical excitations cite:barford2011ultrafast 
*** Dihedral relaxation of S_1 may be slightly faster in ppv3-no2
**** 0.5 ps vs 0.55 ps
*** Dihedral relaxation of S_m significantly faster in ppv3-no2
**** Suggests the increased relaxation is due to quick relaxation of the state population
*** Dihedral relaxation without accounting for trivial crossings is slower
**** Also suggest relaxation is due to quick drop in excited state.  
*** Separation of the of the near and far S_m, before S_1
**** Earlier than what occured in the bla caclulation
*** Dihedral splits with ppv3-no2
**** TODO Could this be because of the nitro group. Short 32 trajectory of PPV3-NO2 w/o methanol groups.
