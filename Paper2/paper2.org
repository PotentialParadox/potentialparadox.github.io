* Introduction
When strong couplings between the vibrational electronic states of freedom
exist, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks. This assumption that nuclear
coordinate motion is negligible to electronic motion fails to be accurate and
molecular dynamics must consider non-adiabatic behaviors in order to
produce reasonably accurate simulations.

This type of research we have a ground thing above the ground state dim sleep
populated manifold of excited States state board often swapping energy in other
words the energy of one state at will be higher than another state at one point
then at a later time the energy of that first date could be visited the energy
of the other ones so we must all think you track of the order of the states. As
a general rule we also need to be solving the structure ecrater the creation on
the Fly for each electronic level . Calculating the potential energy surfaces
for all these dates is quite complex and requires solutions to the shrinker
equation the backend methods used to calculate these put the Chinese Services
can range to externally complicated density functional Theory methods to others
much more simplified to me empirical methods effort must be made to balance
accuracy to efficiency in this regards.

PPV_3-NO_2's high energy barrier between its ground state and
first excited-state matches up with Kasha’s rule.

The characteristics of this electronic manifold overtime to be very useful to a
multiple of different you scenarios such as the residence in which we care
deeply about the molecules lowest level excited state or in light harvesting
Light-harvesting applications and where the molecule excitation energy is being
transferred to charge separation. The study of photosynthesis can also be how to
buy this type of research that focuses on the non-radiative crossings The ground
state.

Ton of research has gone in the study and he's not on a team that is molecular
Dynamics methodologies methodologies range from the extremely complicated
inexpensive approaches such as I can figure is time-dependent Arkansas cabin air

Dynamics package developed at Los Alamos.

method to extend the capabilities of the non adiabatic cold using the Amber

Are focuses on organic conjugated molecule specifically ppv 3 and PPP 2 as shown
in the diagram.
* Theoretical Methodology
** Adiabatic Motion
To find the excited state energies during dynamics, we calculate the Liouville
eigenvalue equation

\begin{align*}
  \hat{\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} = \Omega\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}
\end{align*}

with \(\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}\) being the two-particle Louiville operator and
\(\Omega\) the energy difference between the \(\alpha\) state and the ground
state, where the Liouville operator can be found analytically by

\begin{align*}
  \hat{\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} = \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}}(\mathbf{\rho}_{00}), \mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} \right]
  + \left[ \mathbf{V}^{\vec{R}}(\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}), \mathbf{\rho}_{00} \right]
\end{align*}

and the single electron density matrix for each state of the system is described by

\begin{align*}
  (\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha})_{nm} =  \left< \psi_{alpha} \right| c_m^\dagger c_n \left| \psi_0 \right>.
\end{align*}

The forces are then calculated analytically by the gradient of the ground state
energy and the excited state energy.

\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla} E_{\alpha} = \vec{\nabla} E_0 + \vec{\nabla} \Omega_{\alpha}
\end{align*}

With the gradient of the ground state being calculated by

\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla} E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{Tr} \left[ \left( \mathbf{t}^{\vec{R}} + \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} \right) \mathbf{\rho}_{00} \right]
\end{align*}

and the gradient of the excited state being

\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla}\Omega_{\alpha} = \mathbf{Tr} \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} (\mathbf{\rho}_{\alpha\alpha} - \mathbf{\rho}_{00})\right]
  + \mathbf{Tr} \left[\mathbf{V}^{\vec{R}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}^\dagger \mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} \right]
\end{align*}

where \(\mathbf{\rho}_{ij}\) represents the density or transition density matrix for states i and
j, \( \mathbf{F} \) is the Fock matrix,  \( \mathbf{t} \) is the kinetic operator acting on
one-electron and \( \mathbf{V} \) is the column interchange operator.
** Non-Adiabatic
As each trajectory moves along its potential energy surface, Tully's
Fewest Switches Surface Hopping algorithm (FSSH) determines when a state
transitions occurs.cite:tully2012perspective,tully1990molecular  

We define the Hamiltonian be defined as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyHamiltonian} \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{T}_{R} +
  \mathbf{H}_{0}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{R})
\end{equation}
where the matrix elements of the electron Hamiltonian are

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyVelements}
  V_{ij}(\mathbf(R))=\left<\phi_i(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\right|\mathbf{H}_{0}\left.(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\phi_j(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\right>
\end{equation}

At each step we perform a montecarlo like decision

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyjump2} 
\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}g_{ij} < \zeta  \le \sum_{j=1}^{k}g_{ij}
\end{equation}
hopping from state i to k when
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyjump1} 
  \zeta < g_{ik}
\end{equation}
where \zeta is a uniformly distributed random number from 0 to 1, and

\begin{equation}
g_{ik} = \frac{b_{ki}(t=0)\Delta t}{a_{ii}(t=0)}
\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullyb2a} 
b_{kj} =
        \frac{2}{\hbar}\Im\left(a_{kj}^*V_{kj}\right) - 2\Re\left(a_{kj}^*
         \dot{\mathbf{R}} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{kj}\right).
\end{equation}
$a_{kj}$ are the off diagonals of the density matrix $a_{kj} = c_k^* c_j$ and
$\mathbf{d}_{kj}$ is the non-adiabatic coupling vector

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tullynacoupling} 
\mathbf{d}_{kj}\mathbf(R) =
  \left<\phi_{k}(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\right|\mathbf{\nabla}_{\mathbf{R}}\left.\phi_j(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\right>.
\end{equation}
We use the Collect Oscillator Approach to calculate the non-adiabatic coupling
terms $\mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{kj}$ ``on the
fly''. cite:tommasini2001electronic,tretiak1996collective,tretiak2009representation,chernyak2000density

* Computational Design
#+caption: Swim-lane diagram describing the common timestep of the SANDER-NEXMD interface. label:scheme:nasqm 
  [[./scripted_diagrams/nasqm_overview.png]] 

The swim-lane chart in figure ref:scheme:nasqm describes a common time-step that occurs within the SANDER-NEXMD interface.
First users initiate the program through SANDER, a program found in AMBERTOOLS. 
SANDER uses NEXMD to calculate the energies and forces of the QM atoms, check for trivial crossings, and propagate the quantum coefficients.
With these results, SANDER performs the QM/MM procedures to derive the accelerations and velocities for the classical time step. 
NEXMD then decides whether to perform a state transitions, adjusting the velocities as needed. 
Finally SANDER propagates the nuclear coordinates and the cycle continues for the rest of the dynamics.

SANDER calls NEXMD providing the function calls with the QM coordinates, MM charges, and Langevin thermostat parameters. 
NEXMD calculates the energies of the QM atoms with electrostatic interactions from the MM point charges using CIS, TDHF, or TDDFT. 
A variety of Hamiltonians are available; however, AM1 has been shown to provide very reasonable computational cost to accuracy for our systems of interest.cite:silva2010benchmark

After calculating energies, NEXMD performs a check for non-avoided trivial crossings.
Computational feasibility of this step requires the calculations of the non-adiabatic .cite:nelson2020non We use an analytical form of the non-adiabatic coupling derived using the Hellman-Feynman theorem. cite:tommasini2001electronic,chernyak2000density 

\[
 \mathbf{d}_{ab}(\mathbf{R})
= \frac{ \left< \Psi_a (\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R}) \right| \nabla_\mathbf{R}
\hat{H}_{el} (\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}) \left| \Psi_b (\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R})
\right> } { E_b(\mathbf{R}) - E_a(\mathbf{R}) } 
\] 

NEXMD then compares the overlap of the density functions of the current step to those in the previous state. 
If a non-avoided trivial crossings is suspected, addition energy calculations are performed along the interpolation of the classical step, and overlap matrices are compared.
Trivial crossing will result in a change in state number but will continue to propagate along the most recent potential energy surface. 

NEXMD then propagates the quantum coefficients.
Generally, this propagation requires a smaller time-step than whats needed for nuclear coordinate propagation, as such, three or four quantum steps are performed for every classical step. 
These intermediary quantum calculations are performed using nuclear coordinates determined through an interpolation of the classical time step.
Inclusion of the thermostat parameters allow for fined tuned precision in these interpolations.

Forces are then determined using the analytical solution to the gradient of the energies.
For the ground state,
\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla} E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{Tr} \left[ \left( \mathbf{t}^{\vec{R}} + \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} \right) \mathbf{\rho}_{00} \right]
\end{align*},
and for the excitation energy
\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla}\Omega = \mathbf{Tr} \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} (\mathbf{\rho}_{\alpha\alpha} - \mathbf{\rho}_{00})\right]
  + \mathbf{Tr} \left[\mathbf{V}^{\vec{R}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}^\dagger \mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} \right]
\end{align*}
where \(\mathbf{\rho}_{ij}\) represents the density or transition density matrix for states i and
j, \( \mathbf{F} \) is the Fock matrix,  \( \mathbf{t} \) is the kinetic operator acting on
one-electron and \( \mathbf{V} \) is the column interchange operator.

The energies, forces, and electron densities are returned to SANDER where SANDER's built in QM/MM routines performs the QM/MM calculations using the excited state electron density. 
The resulting total forces are then used to update the velocities for both MM and QM atoms for a single timestep and are passed back into NEXMD. 

The aformentioned probability of hopping mentioned in theoretical methods can be expanded to 
\[ 
g_{\alpha \rightarrow \beta} = 
-\frac{\Delta t}{\hbar}
\frac{2\Re\left( c_\alpha(t)c_\beta^*(t) \dot{\vec{R}} \cdot \vec{d}_{\alpha\beta} \right)}
{| c_\alpha(t) |^2} 
\] 
which NEXMD now uses to determine whether a hop between the adiabatic states should occur.
If a hop occurs, the nuclear velocities are adjusted along the non-adiabatic coupling vector to conserve energy. 
If a state transition occurs, the velocities of the nuclear atoms are adjusted along the non-adiabatic coupling vectors to conserve energy.
With the new state chosen, AMBER now uses the average velocities to propagate the nuclear coordinates.
New random numbers are generated for the thermostats when appropriate.

* Computational Timings
* Simulation Methods
[[./scripted_diagrams/simulations-1.png]]
** Ground State Sampling
We equilibrated the system to a temperature set to 300K. To collect a broad
enough sampling, we sampled from a 1024 ps, with a 0.5 fs timestep fully
classical trajectories using the AMBER force field. We performed a separate
trajectory for each situation combination of solute / with solvent including
whether the solvent was included in the QM calculations. We had a total of 6
separate 1024 ps classical trajectories, PPV3 in Vacuum, CH_3OH, and 5QM CH_3OH
and PPV_3-NO_2 in Vacuum, CH_3OH, and 5QM CH_3OH. 1024 snapshots where taken at
1ps, 2ps .. 1024ps. We used the final frame of those tranjectories as the
initial conditions for an additional 4ps using the AM1 semiempical Hamiltonian
Born-Oppenheimer on the molecules to be included in future QM calculations to
allow the system to relax. The 4 ps timescale was determined using the
information form the previous paper. The simulations were described the Langevin
equations at a temperature set to 300 K with the Langevin friction parameter set
to 2 ps^{-1}. The final frames of these QM trajectories were then used as the
initial conditions for the following pulse pump calculations.
** Pulse Pump Calculations
*** Explain the pulse pump experiment
Pump-Probe Spectroscopy is and experimental technique commonly performed in the
study of ultrafast electonic statte dynamics. In the case of conjugated polymers
in can be used to study the localized excictronic tranisions that are
accessible through and excitation of the S1 state but not the ground state S0.
To simulate this behavior, we take the final snapshot of the QM ground state
calculations and perform a single point calculation at the S1 state to find the
next state with the highest oscillator strength.
*** TODO Excited State Density Chart
We looked specifically for a large peak in oscillator strength, at least twice
the amount of any other. Those trajectories that failed to meet those conditions
were filtered out from the following calculations. We recorded the successful
state transitions and used them for the S_m state tully excited state
calculations dynamics.
** S_m Non Adiabatic Dynamics
Using the same snapshot used for the Pulse Pump calculations and their
corresponding trajectories, we used the previously calculated state from the
pulse pump as our initial state and perform a 500 fs dyanmics with timestep of
0.5 fs, and nuclear coordinate dyanmics described by the Langevin dynamics with
temperature set to 300K and friction set to 20^{-1}. The dyanmics were allowed
to behave non-adiabatically and we tested for trivial unavoided crossing between
excited states.The dynamics did not include QM ewald.

 Figure ref:fig:all-populations shows the population of each state calculated as
 the number of trajectories at the state's potential energy surface over the
 total number of trajectories. S_m represents the initial state calculated using
 the pulse pump calculations previously done. States S_7 and S_9 are included as
 the only other "slow" states, or states that reached a population of more than
 0.05. The other states were excluded from the graph. These charts show that the
 addition of the NO_2 oligimors dramatically speed up the state relaxation. S_m
 ranged from S_9 to S_15 for PPV_3 and S_11 to S_21 for PPV_{3}-NO_{2}. Figure
 ref:fig:s1-populations, shows the rise of the S_{1} populations over the first
 500 fs after excitation. We model these rises by fitting the curves to the
 function
 \begin{equation}
 f(t) = \frac{Ae^{t/\tau}}{A+e^{t/\tau}} - \frac{A}{1+A}
 \end{equation}
 where $t$ is time, $\tau$ is the relaxation, and $A$ is a constant that
 normalizes such that the populations remain between 0 and 1. The results are displayed in ref:table:s1. 
 We clearly see that adding a test for trivial-nonavoided crossing slows the rate
 of relaxation from a time constant of 258~fs. This is to be expected since we
 are now preventing transitions (mostly downward) that should not occur. The
 methanol have mixed results with regards to PPV3 and seem to slightly slow the
 relaxation of PPV3-NO_2. Experiments using ultrafast spectroscopy have shown that
 for PPV thin films the time constant for relaxations should be around 200 fs.
 However, that was on thin films and for PPV_3, the energy gap !! Average S_1 ->
 S_m energy gap) than in the thin film (0.8eV). Previous research using the
 NAESMD framework have shown a time constant of 394 fs, but this was without the
 test for trivial non-avoided crossings.

  [[./Images/population_fit_tabulation/s1.png]]

** Potential Energies
The potential energies averaged over !!N-PPV3!! and !!N-PPV3-NO2!! completed
trajectories are shown in figures ref:fig:ppv3-potential and
ref:fig:ppv3-no2-potential. The corresponding S_0 and S_1 states are shown for
comparison and are the last 500 fs of a 10 ps run for each of those states. As
the initial S_m trajectories reduce the potential energies reduce towards the
corresponding S_1 steady state energies. From figure
ref:fig:ppv3-no2-s1-populations, we can see that by 400 fs, most of the population
in the PPV_{3}-NO_{2} trajectories are on the S_1 potential energy surface.
After 400ps, any reduction in the potential energy is due to adiabatic
relaxation. We include for comparison in figure ref:fig:ppv3-potential the
potential energy relaxation form the initial S_m trajectories without using a
test for trivial unavoided crossings tracking the spacialization of the
electronic transitions as implemented by the Tretiak group labeled (S_{m} Vacuum
NT). By taking into account a test for trivial non-avoided crossings, we see a
notable reduction in the rate of relaxation. This matches what we see in the
growth of the S_1 populations as seen in ref:fig:ppv3-s1-populations, where
without the tests for trivial crossings, the S_1 state rises much quicker. 

The energies between the solvent and vacuum. The potential energie of the solute
in vacuum is noticablly smaller than in vacuum as to be expected. The rate of
relaxation in methanol for PPV_3-NO_2 is slightly faster than in vacuum, but
negligable in the case PPV_3. Adding the 5 solvents to the calculation did not
seem to result in any noticable differences in regards to the potential energy
relaxation rate for either PPV_3 or PPV_{3}-NO_{2}. There's a larger difference
between the S_1 relaxed potential energies for PPV_{3{-NO_2 than there is at the
initial S_{m} states.

** Bond Length Adjustment
In figure [[ref:fig:bla-vacuum]], the BLA for both PPV_3 and PPV_{3}-NO_{2} in
vacuum the ground state varies very little the two. We use shades of red the
display the ground-state and shades of green to represent states that start in
S_m and shades of blue the describe a first excited state trajectores. The
ground state has very little variation. The first excited state splits in PPV_{3}-NO_{2},
with the Far Side being described as being the furthest from the Nitro goup.  
States SM and state S1 the atom group further from the Nitro group had a more
distinct variation than the bla with the groups nearest the Nitro group The
variation is most distinct and the first excited States the difference between
the them on the S_m closed group is very much smaller and similar to what we found in
the The potential Energies The Barley the Judgment relaxation, and ppb 3 ml to
is significantly faster than that time of PPP. The ground-state energy that we
found matches values performed from the previous research by Tammie as does the
S5 started to take pla Big billy for the states for the trajectories that
started in the initial M States showed a slider longer time for relaxation than
that found and Tammy's research. FIXME I need to add Tammy's ballet data to the
Bone length adjustment. The very quick relaxation of the bla in the states
suggest that very quickly after the initial excitation, PPV_{3}-NO_{2} quickly
stabilizes and flattens within first 500 fs. Later we will compare this
to the dihedral angle to see if this matches our expectations. Previous research
has shown that after this acceptation an actual Bond indices at the Scribe by
the Wydber index shrinks well showing that the single bonds gain a significant
amount double bond characteristics causing the molecule to Stiffen.

*** Description of the plot
**** Lines are drawn to help guide the eye
**** The S_1 and S_0 state plotted are from previous research
**** Red is ground, Blue is S_1, Green is S_m
**** S_m refers to trajectories that started after the pulse pump
*** Inital Dihedral angle for S_m is lower than ground state
**** Visual analysis as to why
**** Previous paper have found that initial torsional angles strongly determine vertical excitations cite:barford2011ultrafast 
*** Dihedral relaxation of S_1 may be slightly faster in ppv3-no2
**** 0.5 ps vs 0.55 ps
*** Dihedral relaxation of S_m significantly faster in ppv3-no2
**** Suggests the increased relaxation is due to quick relaxation of the state population
*** Dihedral relaxation without accounting for trivial crossings is slower
**** Also suggest relaxation is due to quick drop in excited state.  
*** Separation of the of the near and far S_m, before S_1
**** Earlier than what occured in the bla caclulation
*** Dihedral splits with ppv3-no2
**** TODO Could this be because of the nitro group. Short 32 trajectory of PPV3-NO2 w/o methanol groups.

  - Higher Langevin Friction Coefficients slow population relaxation

  - Following a hop, nuclei evolve on the PES of the new state, and energy is
    conserved by rescaling nuclear velocities along the direction of NACR
  - If the nuclear kinetic energy is insufficient to allow a hop to higher
    energy, then the hop is classically forbidden and is rejected.
  - During NA dynamics, state-speciﬁc forces promote electronic and vibrational
    energy funneling to the lowest excited state (as seen in light harvesting
    dendrimers 44−46 ). These ﬁndings discourage any attempt to address
    photodynamics in extended conjugated molecules using the classical-path
    approximation (CPA), 47
  - This simple method is based on the assumption that wavepackets traveling on
    different surfaces should immediately separate in phase space and evolve
    independently. The approach provides qualitative improvement in the
    agreement between classical and quantum systems 29 at no additional
    computational cost and should also allow the coherent nature of transfer
    dynamics on ultrafast time scales to be captured; however this requires
    further study
  - Diagonal elements of TD matrices represent the net change in the electronic
    density distribution induced on an atomic orbital when undergoing a ground

  - TD analysis allows the evolution of the electronic wave function to be

    adiabatic state populations. 28,42,55
  - Failure to detect trivial unavoided crossings will cause adiabatic states,

  - Split Hamiltonian into three parts
    \begin{equation}
    H = H_{QM} + H_{MM} + H_{QM/MM}

  - For semiempirical Hamiltonians we follow the MOPAC programs, and use the
    full electrostatic interactions between the QM charge density (expanded in a
    STO-6G minimal basis set) and the point charges on the MM atoms.
  - However, it is well under-stood that long range electrostatic interactions
    and solvent effects play an important role in the behavior of solvated
    systems.
  - Dealing with covalent bonds
    - Capping Potential (pseudo bond method)
      - Fictitious element is used to cap each bond between the QM and MM regions
    - Hybrid Orbital approach
      - Hybrid or localized frozen orbitals on the QM atom of the QM-MM covalent pair
    - Link Atom approach (SANDER's)
      - In this approach a link atom, which is typically, but not always, a hydrogen, is placed along the bond between the QM and MM region at a suitable distance (1 Å) to satisfy valence requirements.
      - Case 3 is the method currently implemented in Amber 9 where by the link
        atom interacts with both QM and MM atoms and MM link pair atoms are
        excluded from all electrostatic interactions.
    - People running classical force ﬁeld simulations can generally expect that
      the forces used in MD are accurately the gradients of the potential energy
      so that a NVE simulation should yield constant total energy with respect
      to time. However, this has of- ten not been true for QM/MM simulations
      since the QM portion of a QM/MM calculation uses an iterative SCF
      procedure, the forces are only sufﬁciently accurate to conserve energy if
      the difference in energy between subsequent SCF steps is converged to the
      order of around 1 3 10 28 to 1 3 10 29 kcal/mol.

  - How tammie solves the decoherence problem
  - the quantum coefficients are evolved coherently along each independent
    nuclear trajectory. That is, the phase factors, or quantum amplitudes, are
    retained.
  - We find that methods that have been used successfully for treating small
    systems do not necessarily translate to large polyatomic systems and their
    success depends on the particular system under study.
  - In principle, decoherence can be included by running a swarm of trajectories
    with the same initial conditions but with a different random number sequence
    to determine hops between adiabatic states
  - Further-more, if one of the divergent wavepackets passes through a region of
    strong coupling multiple times, the wavepacket may undergo yet another
    branching event, compounding the original decoherence problem.
  - In general, the disagreement can be caused by classically forbidden
    transitions or by the divergence of independent trajectories following
    passage through a region of strong coupling.
  - Setting coefficients to unity is justified. This method is physically
    justified: at an avoided crossing a wavepacket will generally branch into
    two subpackets carrying the electronic populations. The subpackets,
    traveling on different surfaces, will separate in phase space and, since
    they are unlikely to in- teract again, the time average of their phase
    differences should be zero.
  - We refer to this scheme as instantaneous decoherence (ID) since it is
    based on the assumption that following a hop, divergent wavepackets will
    instantaneously separate in phase space and should immediately undergo
    independent evolution.
  - Another method that has demonstrated its success in treating decoherence
    29–31 while introducing little additional computational effort is the
    energy-based decoherence correc- tion (EDC) developed by Granucci et al. 17,
    18 in which the coefficients are rescaled at each classical time step.
  - The NA-ESMD model combines the FSSH algorithm, as it is used in the MDQT
    method, 1, 33 with “on the fly” cal- culation of the electronic energies,
    gradients, and nonadiabatic coupling vectors for the excited states using a
    Collective Electronic Oscillator (CEO) package. 34–37 The CEO code is based
    on well-tested semiempirical models combined with the Time-Dependent
    Hartree-Fock (TDHF) or the Configuration Interaction singles (CIS) formalism
    to describe correlated excited states. A detailed description of the CEO
    code and NA-ESMD implementation can be found in Refs.
  - As the classical system continues to relax to lower energy, the quantum
    wavepacket gets “left behind.” That is, the wavepacket remains centered at
    higher energy with respect to the current state with only a small quantum
    probability for the lowest energy state despite that it is the classically
    occupied state.
  - One can imagine that all attempted hops should also be treated as
    decoherence events, regardless of whether the hop is allowed or forbidden
    due to energy constraints.
  - Excitation to S m was performed according to Eq. (10) using a laser centered
    at λ laser = 245 nm and the excited state energies and oscillator strengths
    from the theoretical S1 → Sn absorption spectrum. We found that for the S m
    state, m varied from 8 to 12 due to conformational disorder.

  - Original surface hopping method
  - The importance of tunneling and level quantization effects depends on the
    ratio of the atomic wavelength to the characteristic range of the potential.
    Thus these quantum effects are diminished in systems involving large atomic
    masses and large velocities
  - The method must be practical
  - Trajectories must split into branchers
  - We could determine earch possible path and assign a weight based on its probability
  - We however employ use monte carlo with the decision to hop given probabilities
  - The method should obey energy conservation
  - Thus, transitions should be allowed to occur at any place that the
    electronic coupling is significant. This is a major limitation of the
    conventional surface-hopping technique
  - The probability of a final or intermediate outcome should be obtained simply
    by summing the trajectories that achieve that outcome.
  - The nonadiabatic coupling term is
    \begin{equation}
      \left< \phi_k \left. \right| \frac{\partial \phi_j}{\partial t} \right > = \dot{\mathbf{R}} \cdot \mathbf{d}(\mathbf{R})
    \end{equation}
  - Strongest coupling occurs then change of the wave function overlaps the most
    with the new wave function
  - When attempting to compare classical and quantal dynamics, it is generally
    useful to consider the behavior of a swarm of trajectories rather than an
    individual trajectory. With the present method, each trajectory may make a
    sudden switch of states. But for a swarm of trajectories entering a broad
    region of coupling, some trajectories will switch early, others later, and
    the net result will he a gradual flow of flux from one state to the other.
  - The quantum mechanical results show a smooth dependence on energy, whereas
    the trajectory results show a high frequency oscillation.

  - The adiabatic (Born-Oppenheimer 2 ) PES, E(X), is the 3N-dimensional
    hypersurface of the elec- tronic energy of an N-atom system as a function of
    all nu- clear positions X = {X 1 , X 2 , . . . X N }.
  - Molecular ionization, electron-molecule scattering, and single molecule
    electronics are also controlled by nonadiabatic transitions among electronic
    continuum states.
  - In fact, the exponent in Eq. (1) is often called the Massey parameter; 20
    and serves as a rough indication of nearly adiabatic behavior if it is much
    greater than unity—large energy splitting (2) and low velocity and
    diabatic (completely nonadiabatic) behavior if it is much less than
    unity—small splitting, high velocity.
