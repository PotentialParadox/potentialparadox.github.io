* Computational Details
** Ground State Sampling
We equilibrated the system to a temperature set to 300K. To collect a broad
enough sampling, we sampled from a 1024 ps, with a 0.5 fs timestep fully
classical trajectories using the AMBER force field. We performed a separate
trajectory for each situation combination of solute / with solvent including
whether the solvent was included in the QM calculations. We had a total of 6
separate 1024 ps classical trajectories, PPV3 in Vacuum, CH_3OH, and 5QM CH_3OH
and PPV_3-NO_2 in Vacuum, CH_3OH, and 5QM CH_3OH. 1024 snapshots where taken at
1ps, 2ps .. 1024ps. We used the final frame of those tranjectories as the
initial conditions for an additional 4ps using the AM1 semiempical Hamiltonian
Born-Oppenheimer on the molecules to be included in future QM calculations to
allow the system to relax. The 4 ps timescale was determined using the
information form the previous paper. The simulations were described the Langevin
equations at a temperature set to 300 K with the Langevin friction parameter set
to 20 ps^{-1}. The final frames of these QM trajectories were then used as the
initial conditions for the following pulse pump calculations.
** Pulse Pump Calculations
Pump-Probe Spectroscopy is and experimental technique commonly performed in the
study of ultrafast electonic statte dynamics. In the case of conjugated polymers
in can be used to study the dlocalized excictronic
tranisions that are accessible through and excitation of the S1 state but not
the ground state S0. To simulate this behavior, we take the final snapshot of
the QM ground state calculations and perform a single point calculation at the
S1 state to find the next state with the highest oscillator strength. We looked
specifically for a large peak in oscillator strength, at least twice the amount
of any other. Those trajectories that failed to meet those conditions were
filtered out from the following calculations. We recorded the successful state
transitions and used them for the S_m state tully excited state calculations dynamics.
** S_m Non Adiabatic Dynamics
Using the same snapshot used for the Pulse Pump calculations and their
corresponding trajectories, we used the previously calculated state from the
pulse pump as our initial state and perform a 500 fs dyanmics with timestep of
0.5 fs, and nuclear coordinate dyanmics described by the Langevin dynamics with
temperature set to 300K and friction set to 20^{-1}. The dyanmics were allowed
to behave non-adiabatically and we tested for trivial unavoided crossing between
excited states.The dynamics did not include QM ewald.

Figure ref:fig:all-populations shows the population of each state calculated as
the number of trajectories at the state's potential energy surface over the
total number of trajectories. S_m represents the initial state calculated using
the pulse pump calculations previously done. States S_7 and S_9 are included as
the only other "slow" states, or states that reached a population of more than
0.05. The other states were excluded from the graph. These charts show that the
addition of the NO_2 oligimors dramatically speed up the state relaxation. S_m
ranged from S_9 to S_15 for PPV_3 and S_11 to S_21 for PPV_{3}-NO_{2}. Figure
ref:fig:s1-populations, shows the rise of the S_{1} populations over the first
500 fs after excitation. We model these rises by fitting the curves to the
function
\begin{equation}
f(t) = \frac{Ae^{t/\tau}}{A+e^{t/\tau}} - \frac{A}{1+A}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is time, $\tau$ is the relaxation, and $A$ is a constant that
normalizes such that the populations remain between 0 and 1. The results are displayed in ref:table:s1. 
We clearly see that adding a test for trivial-nonavoided crossing slows the rate
of relaxation from a time constant of 258~fs. This is to be expected since we
are now preventing transitions (mostly downward) that should not occur. The
methanol have mixed results with regards to PPV3 and seem to slightly slow the
relaxation of PPV3-NO_2. Experiments using ultrafast spectroscopy have shown that
for PPV thin films the time constant for relaxations should be around 200 fs.
However, that was on thin films and for PPV_3, the energy gap !! Average S_1 ->
S_m energy gap) than in the thin film (0.8eV). Previous research using the
NAESMD framework have shown a time constant of 394 fs, but this was without the
test for trivial non-avoided crossings.

** Potential Energies
The potential energies averaged over !!N-PPV3!! and !!N-PPV3-NO2!! completed
trajectories are shown in figures ref:fig:ppv3-potential and
ref:fig:ppv3-no2-potential. The corresponding S_0 and S_1 states are shown for
comparison and are the last 500 fs of a 10 ps run for each of those states. As
the initial S_m trajectories reduce the potential energies reduce towards the
corresponding S_1 steady state energies. From figure
ref:fig:ppv3-no2-s1-populations, we can see that by 400 fs, most of the population
in the PPV_{3}-NO_{2} trajectories are on the S_1 potential energy surface.
After 400ps, any reduction in the potential energy is due to adiabatic
relaxation. We include for comparison in figure ref:fig:ppv3-potential the
potential energy relaxation form the initial S_m trajectories without using a
test for trivial unavoided crossings tracking the spacialization of the
electronic transitions as implemented by the Tretiak group labeled (S_{m} Vacuum
NT). By taking into account a test for trivial non-avoided crossings, we see a
notable reduction in the rate of relaxation. This matches what we see in the
growth of the S_1 populations as seen in ref:fig:ppv3-s1-populations, where
without the tests for trivial crossings, the S_1 state rises much quicker. 

The energies between the solvent and vacuum. The potential energie of the solute
in vacuum is noticablly smaller than in vacuum as to be expected. The rate of
relaxation in methanol for PPV_3-NO_2 is slightly faster than in vacuum, but
negligable in the case PPV_3. Adding the 5 solvents to the calculation did not
seem to result in any noticable differences in regards to the potential energy
relaxation rate for either PPV_3 or PPV_{3}-NO_{2}. There's a larger difference
between the S_1 relaxed potential energies for PPV_{3{-NO_2 than there is at the
initial S_{m} states.
