   :END:
During ultra-fast photovolatic processes, the Born-Openheimer
appoximation breaks, and accounting for non-adiabatic behavior become
necessary.  These situations occur frequently within processes of
interest to photochemistry and photophysics.  For example, the
excitation to a non-equlibrium state followed by a relaxation through
internal conversion is a process common to processes such as
photosynthesis, solar-cell photo-absoprtion, optical detectors, and
the excitation of the visual nerve.  Multiple methods to have been
proposed and used to simulate these non-adiabatic processes.  These
methods include treating the nuclear coordinates quantum mechanically
or simiclassically, or by using a hybrid quantum mechanical, classical
treatment to account for the non-adiabaticity.  One of the more
popular version of the latter, and the one which we use in this work,
is Molecular Dynamics with Quantum Transitions (MDQT), were the system
propogates classically along adiabatic potential energy surfaces, but
a quantum evalutation is made at each time step to determine whether
to transition to another state.\\

For many areas in which nonadiabatic dynamics simulations would be of
interest, solvents play a crucial role.  In situations where ultrafast
electronic relaxations occur, the electronic decay is often faster
than the time for the solvent to equilibrate.  As such, Implicit
solvents, which adjusts instantaneously to any changes, become
imprecise approximation However performing non-adiabatic dynamics on
such large systems is far too computationally expensive.  To ease the
computational cost we can employ QM/MM methodologies to perform the
non-adiabatic calculation only on the areas of interest.  Similar
methods have been employed in the study of retinal photochemistry and
organic semiconductors.  In this work we implement a new method of
performing non-adiabatic QM/MM using the SANDER package AMBERTOOLS
combined with the high performance Non-Adiabatic simulator NEXMD.  We
further analyze the effects of including near solvent molecules within
the QM region.\\

* TODO Theoretical Methodology [1/2]
** DONE Adiabatic Calculations                                       :ignore:
Adiatic motion is managed by SANDER using the NEXMD software package to calculate the semiemprical QM energies and forces.
NEXMD uses a modified version of the  SQM package from AMBERTOOlS  for these calcuations which SANDER links to by default.
As such, the ground state energies and forces from SANDER paired with NEXMD vs SANDER in its default configuration are identical. 
This modified version howerver also provides the excited state energies and forces. Previous work have shown methods for linking
these two packages to provide excited state adiabatic QM/MM simulations . *Personal Citation.* 

To find the excited state energies during dynamics, NEXMD employs the collective electronic oscillator (CEO) method developed by Mec... etc.
This method is similar to the random phase approximation and is compatible with Kohn-Sham DFT or Hartee-Fock.

A quick overview of this methodology is as follows. We start with the Liouville eigenvalue equation.

\begin{align*}
  \hat{\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} = \Omega\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}
\end{align*}


with \(\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}\) being the two-particle Louiville operator and
\(\Omega\) the energy difference between the \(\alpha\) state and the ground
state. \(\rho_{0\alpha}\) is the single- electron density matrix

\begin{align*}
  (\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha})_{nm} =  \left< \psi_{\alpha} \right| c_m^\dagger c_n \left| \psi_0 \right>.
\end{align*}
where \(\psi_{g}\) and \(\psi_{\alpha}\) are the single-electron wavefunctions for the groundstate and singly excited state \(\alpha\), and
\(c_m^\dagger\) and \(c_n\) are the creation and annihilation operator respectively. The coefficients for the atomic orbital basit sets are derived prior using the QM/MM methodology from the SQM package.\cite{walker2008implementation} The Liouville operator can be found analytically using 

\begin{align*}
  \hat{\mathbf{\mathcal{L}}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} = \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}}(\mathbf{\rho}_{00}), \mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} \right]
  + \left[ \mathbf{V}^{\vec{R}}(\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}), \mathbf{\rho}_{00} \right]
\end{align*}

where \(\textbf{F}^{\vec{R}}\) is the Fock operator and \(\textbf{V}^{\vec{R}}\) is the column interchange operator.

The forces are also calculated analytically using the gradient of the ground state
energy and the excited state energy.

\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla} E_{\alpha} = \vec{\nabla} E_0 + \vec{\nabla} \Omega_{\alpha}
\end{align*}

With the gradient of the ground state being calculated by

\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla} E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{Tr} \left[ \left( \mathbf{t}^{\vec{R}} + \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} \right) \mathbf{\rho}_{00} \right]
\end{align*}
where \(\textbf{t}\) is the single-electron kinetic operator.

The gradient of the excited state can derived using

\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla}\Omega_{\alpha} = \mathbf{Tr} \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} (\mathbf{\rho}_{\alpha\alpha} - \mathbf{\rho}_{00})\right]
  + \mathbf{Tr} \left[\mathbf{V}^{\vec{R}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}^\dagger \mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} \right]
\end{align*}

where \(\mathbf{\rho}_{ij}\) represents the density or transition density matrix for states i and
j, \( \mathbf{F} \) is the Fock matrix and \( \mathbf{V} \) is the column interchange operator.

The MDQT approach utilized in this work as a modified version of the

approximated using a swarm of independent trajectories.  During time
steps, these trajectories propagate along adiabatic surfaces; However,
between time steps, these trajectories are allowed to transition from
one state to another in a Monte Carlo like fashion.  That number of

 Inconsistencies arise from solely using the Tully surface hopping approach.
 Trajectories transfer between  the various adiabatic potential energy surfaces instantaneously based off the QM state coefficients.
 These coefficients are determined using the integral of the TDSE on multiple trajectories.
 Each trajectory if unmodified will keep in phase even after spatial separation.
 Furthermore, if dealing with a system with a dense electronic state structure, its likely that the ordering of these states will switch during general dynamics.
 We apply a dechohence correction as well as a trivial crossing accounting system as performed in previous research.

** DONE Summary of the Swim-Lane Diagram                             :ignore:
The swim-lane chart in figure ref:scheme:nasqm describes a common time-step that
occurs within the SANDER-NEXMD interface. First users initiate the program
through SANDER, a program found in AMBERTOOLS. SANDER uses NEXMD to calculate
the energies and forces of the QM atoms, check for trivial crossings, and
propagate the quantum coefficients. With these results, SANDER performs the
QM/MM procedures to derive the accelerations and velocities for the classical
time step. NEXMD then decides whether to perform a state transitions, adjusting
the velocities as needed. Finally SANDER propagates the nuclear coordinates and
the cycle continues for the rest of the dynamics.

When users initiate SANDER, they're provide the usual SANDER inputs of a
coordinate, parameter, and sander control files. In addition they will include a file specific to
NEXMD which describes the QM and Non-adiabatic behavior.

This interface, incorporates SANDER's implementation of QM/MM as described in
previous literature to generate a solvent inclusive ground state density matrix utilized by NEXMD's excited
state calculations.

Sander controls the interactions between the QM and MM regions.


SANDER calls NEXMD providing the function calls with the QM coordinates, MM
charges, and Langevin thermostat parameters. NEXMD calculates the energies of
the QM atoms with electrostatic interactions from the MM point charges using
CIS, TDHF, or TDDFT. A variety of Hamiltonians are available; however, AM1 has
been shown to provide very reasonable computational cost to accuracy for our
systems of interest.cite:silva2010benchmark. An analysis of parameter choices
can be found in previous literature.cite:nelson2012nonadiabatic

After calculating energies, NEXMD performs a check for non-avoided trivial
crossings. Computational feasibility of this step requires the calculations of
the non-adiabatic coupling.cite:nelson2020non We use an analytical form of the
non-adiabatic coupling derived using the Hellman-Feynman theorem.
cite:tommasini2001electronic,chernyak2000density

\[
 \mathbf{d}_{ab}(\mathbf{R})
= \frac{ \left< \Psi_a (\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R}) \right| \nabla_\mathbf{R}
\hat{H}_{el} (\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}) \left| \Psi_b (\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{R})
\right> } { E_b(\mathbf{R}) - E_a(\mathbf{R}) } 
\] 

NEXMD then compares the overlap of the density functions of the current step to
those in the previous state. If a non-avoided trivial crossings is suspected,
addition energy calculations are performed along the interpolation of the
classical step, and overlap matrices are compared. Trivial crossing will result
in a change in state number but will continue to propagate along the most recent
potential energy surface.

NEXMD then propagates the quantum coefficients.
Generally, this propagation requires a smaller time-step than whats needed for nuclear coordinate propagation, as such, three or four quantum steps are performed for every classical step. 
These intermediary quantum calculations are performed using nuclear coordinates determined through an interpolation of the classical time step.
Inclusion of the thermostat parameters allow for fined tuned precision in these interpolations.

Forces are then determined using the analytical solution to the gradient of the energies.
For the ground state,
\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla} E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{Tr} \left[ \left( \mathbf{t}^{\vec{R}} + \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} \right) \mathbf{\rho}_{00} \right]
\end{align*},
and for the excitation energy
\begin{align*}
  \vec{\nabla}\Omega = \mathbf{Tr} \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\vec{R}} (\mathbf{\rho}_{\alpha\alpha} - \mathbf{\rho}_{00})\right]
  + \mathbf{Tr} \left[\mathbf{V}^{\vec{R}}\mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha}^\dagger \mathbf{\rho}_{0\alpha} \right]
\end{align*}
where \(\mathbf{\rho}_{ij}\) represents the density or transition density matrix for states i and
j, \( \mathbf{F} \) is the Fock matrix,  \( \mathbf{t} \) is the kinetic operator acting on
one-electron and \( \mathbf{V} \) is the column interchange operator.

The energies, forces, and electron densities are returned to SANDER where SANDER's built in QM/MM routines performs the QM/MM calculations using the excited state electron density. 
The resulting total forces are then used to update the velocities for both MM and QM atoms for a single timestep and are passed back into NEXMD. 

The aformentioned probability of hopping mentioned in theoretical methods can be expanded to 
\[ 
g_{\alpha \rightarrow \beta} = 
-\frac{\Delta t}{\hbar}
\frac{2\Re\left( c_\alpha(t)c_\beta^*(t) \dot{\vec{R}} \cdot \vec{d}_{\alpha\beta} \right)}
{| c_\alpha(t) |^2} 
\] 
which NEXMD now uses to determine whether a hop between the adiabatic states should occur.
If a hop occurs, the nuclear velocities are adjusted along the non-adiabatic coupling vector to conserve energy. 
If a state transition occurs, the velocities of the nuclear atoms are adjusted along the non-adiabatic coupling vectors to conserve energy.
With the new state chosen, AMBER now uses the average velocities to propagate the nuclear coordinates.
New random numbers are generated for the thermostats when appropriate.

 Figure ref:fig:all-populations shows the population of each state calculated as
 the number of trajectories at the state's potential energy surface over the
 total number of trajectories. S_m represents the initial state calculated using
 the pulse pump calculations previously done. States S_7 and S_9 are included as
 the only other "slow" states, or states that reached a population of more than
 0.05. The other states were excluded from the graph. These charts show that the
 addition of the NO_2 oligimors dramatically speed up the state relaxation. S_m
 ranged from S_9 to S_15 for PPV_3 and S_11 to S_21 for PPV_{3}-NO_{2}. Figure
 ref:fig:s1-populations, shows the rise of the S_{1} populations over the first
 500 fs after excitation. We model these rises by fitting the curves to the
 function
 \begin{equation}
 f(t) = \frac{Ae^{t/\tau}}{A+e^{t/\tau}} - \frac{A}{1+A}
 \end{equation}
 where $t$ is time, $\tau$ is the relaxation, and $A$ is a constant that
 normalizes such that the populations remain between 0 and 1. The results are displayed in ref:table:s1. 
 We clearly see that adding a test for trivial-nonavoided crossing slows the rate
 of relaxation from a time constant of 258~fs. This is to be expected since we
 are now preventing transitions (mostly downward) that should not occur. The
 methanol have mixed results with regards to PPV3 and seem to slightly slow the
 relaxation of PPV3-NO_2. Experiments using ultrafast spectroscopy have shown that
 for PPV thin films the time constant for relaxations should be around 200 fs.
 However, that was on thin films and for PPV_3, the energy gap !! Average S_1 ->
 S_m energy gap) than in the thin film (0.8eV). Previous research using the
 NAESMD framework have shown a time constant of 394 fs, but this was without the
