- Problem
  - Long conjugated polymers are very good at absorbing energy
  - Picture of a nano-star
  - particle in a box
  - 2 -> 3 -> 4
  - Strange things can happen in the excited state to either speed or slow this relaxation
  - Most molecule dynamics programs assume that the motion of the electrons are decoupled from electrons
    - We're assuming that the electrons are infinitely lighter and quicker than the nuclei.
    - In this situation, the motion of the nuclie are dependent on the
      electronic state, and the electronic state is dependent on the nuclie.
    - How do we deal with this coupling?
- Solutions
  - Run Classical Ground State Dynamics then perform Excited Sated Energy Calculations on snapshots
    - Excited State dynamics could be different.
      - In the molecules I studied for example, the excited state had a
        much more planer dynamics than ground state
  - Run dynamics using the average forces of all the relevant excited states (Ehrenfest)
    - Often the average force is not a very good approximation of either. 
    - Think torsion in either direction. The average of these two will be no
      torsion, but that doesn't represent either very well.
  - Fewest Switches Surface Hopping (A form of MDQT)
    - Run a swarm of trajectories that are allowed to switch between different states
      - The proportion of the population that are on a certain state represent the probability of the state.
      - Can be very expensive and requires some approximations
- FSSH
  - General Outline of the Dynamics
    - Very Long MM trajectory
    - Snapshot Every 1 PS, run QM Ground State
    - Excite the System
    - Allow each of these trajectories relax on their own.
      - Sum the population in each state to get state probabilities over time.
      - Analyze absorption and emission properties by looking at frequencies and oscillator strenghts
  - The Long MM Trajectory
    - The goal of our analysis is to derive the probability of states of a solute in solution.
      - Their are quite a lot of possible conformations for a molecule
      - A long run is necessary for decent sampling
    - 1 PS between sample
    - 500-1000 Samples for 40-60~ish atoms
  - The QM Ground State Calculation
    - Picture of Energy Relaxation
    - The Algorithm used to decide whether to jump is very sensitive to energies.
    - QM/MM energies are not going to be the same as MM
    - Some time is needed to properly relax
  - Excite the System
    - Show Frank-Condon Chart
    - We use laser excitations with a wave shape similar to that done in experiment
    - Due to quantum uncertainty these states are also chosen base on a distribution Frank-Condon method
    - Energy is not conserved
    - Velocities and Coordinates are maintained in this step
  - Let the system relax to steady state
    - show overlapping state diagram
    - The molecule will start at a very high excited state
    - When near a crossing of the energies, we have a very strong coupling, the state can shift
    - when there's a switch the velocities of the atoms are adjusted to conserve energy.
      - Draw diagram of a diagram on the ipad
  - Analyze the results
    - Show Excited State Energy Relaxation
    - Show Excited State Population Decay
- Why With Solvent
  - NEXMD can perform the above calculations already
  - The choice to switch states is sensitive to energies
  - Shift in emission and absorption spectra (Solvatochromic) are known to occur.
  - NEXMD uses SQM as a backend, which is part of AMBERTOOLS.
    - Should make it trivial to use a library in AMBER (it doesn't :( )
  - Applications such as sensors, fluorescent tags, L.E.D's ......

- Spectra Shift of PPV3-NO2
  - Show Emission Spectra
  - Solvents with higher dielectric constants cause more a of shift
  - Explain that this is with 20 closest QM Solvents
  - larger Stokes shifts to chromophore aggregation
    where the close-packed PPVOs have strong intermolecular interactions leading
    to the appearance of low-lying weakly emitting intermolecular excited
    states.
  - We prescribe smaller Stokes shifts as resulting from the dipoleâˆ’dipole
    (i.e., solvent-PPVO) interactions, controlled by the diffof ground and
    excited state permanent dipoles of the substituted PPVO, as well as solvent
    polarity, constituting the commonly observed solvatochromic effects.
